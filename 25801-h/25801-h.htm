<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>FLAME</h3>
</div>

<p>The flame ascended, ending in a little
spiral of smoke curling upward in the
night air.
</p>
<p>Overhead the stars shone, the pine trees
formed dark shadows.
</p>
<p>Within the radius of the firelight a girl
leaned forward, her eyes fastened upon a
drawing she held in her lap. One could see
only vague outlines. The light danced over
the figure of the girl, her bright, reddish-gold
hair, cut short and held in place with an
amber comb, her slender shoulders, the unconsciously
graceful poise of her body.
</p>
<p>She turned to glance anxiously at another
figure lying outstretched upon the ground
only a few feet away.
</p>
<p>This girl appeared to be sleeping. Her eyes
were closed and she was breathing fitfully.
</p>
<p>Suddenly she opened her eyes and smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tory Drew, aren&#8217;t you ever going to
sleep?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;Is it your intention
to sit up all night and keep guard over me?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
I told you that I was not suffering in the
least. My fall seems not to have injured me,
only for some strange reason has made it
difficult for me to walk. We have been
longing to spend a night out of doors alone
ever since we arrived at our camp in Beechwood
Forest. This is an unexpected opportunity,
yet you do not look grateful. Small
wonder if you are never going to sleep!
What time do you think it is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Victoria Drew leaned closer toward the
fire and looked at her wrist watch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is half-past twelve o&#8217;clock, Kara. The
witching hour over and I have seen no woodland
spirits come to haunt us, and no human
beings. I am afraid my signals have failed
to attract attention. The other girls at camp
must have decided to give us up for lost and
await our return in the morning; I am sorry
for your sake. Are you sure you are not
uncomfortable?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory arose and bent over her companion,
not so convinced that the entire absence from
pain, which Kara insisted upon, was absolute
proof that she was not seriously hurt.
</p>
<p>In the firelight the other girl&#8217;s face appeared
white and unreal. To any one so impressionable
as Tory the past few hours bore a
semblance of unreality.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>Early in the morning of the previous day
she and Katherine Moore had set out from
their camp in Beechwood Forest to spend the
day alone among the hills. For some time
they had been planning this excursion when
the duties and amusements of camp life made
a break possible. How differently from their
plan and expectation this day had gone!
</p>
<p>As Kara was beginning to fall asleep again
Tory need no longer conceal her anxiety.
</p>
<p>By the fire, now freshly piled with pine
cones and branches, she sat down and propping
her chin in her hands, gazed deep into
the burning embers.
</p>
<p>The night was very still, save for a light
wind in the tree tops.
</p>
<p>On the ground beside her, with a stone
keeping them from blowing away, lay the
result of her day&#8217;s work. She had sketched
all morning while Kara wandered about or
else rested and read.
</p>
<p>Before daylight they had wakened in their
Girl Scout Camp in Beechwood Forest. By
dawn, with their luncheon packed and her
sketching outfit, they had set out to explore
the heart of the hills, a purple rim bordering
the far side of their own camping site.
</p>
<p>During the previous winter in the small
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
Connecticut village Tory faithfully had fulfilled
her promise to her artist father. She
had made no attempt to go on with her
drawing and painting, devoting all her time
and energy to her school, her new home and
her Girl Scout Troop.
</p>
<p>With summer had come the release from
her promise.
</p>
<p>These days of camping in the woods with
the other Girl Scouts recalled the enchanting
months outdoors she had spent with her
father. Every green tree outlined against
the summer sky, their canoes on the lake
before the camping grounds, the Girl Scouts
at work or at play, all were pictures Tory
longed to transfer to line and color.
</p>
<p>Until to-day the business of getting settled
at their summer camp had left scant opportunity
for artistic effort outside the camping
arrangements.
</p>
<p>Tory picked up the pile of sketches on the
ground beside her. She studied each one
carefully and then tossed it into the fire.
</p>
<p>Her present work was valueless; she had
become so hopelessly out of practice.
</p>
<p>Finally her eyes rested on a single sheet of
drawing paper. On the instant her expression
altered. This sketch was not without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
worth. She had drawn it with pastels and
in the light from the camp fire. The lines
were crude and the colors too vivid, but it
showed the figure of a girl lying on the ground,
her eyelids closed, her figure expressing a
curious quiet.
</p>
<p>The lower part of the body was covered.
</p>
<p>At present Tory Drew was without the
khaki coat which she had worn earlier in the
day. Beside the figure the smoke and flame
of the camp fire formed light and shadow.
</p>
<p>Tory sighed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At least this will serve for our camp log!
The other girls can see how Kara looked during
this interminable night. She will be able
to write the account of her fall. I remember
that I was diligently at work upon an impossible
drawing of a line of hills when I
heard the noise of a landslide. There was a
sound of earth and rocks being torn from
their foundation and tumbling and sliding
down an embankment. I scarcely looked up.
Kara had disappeared for a walk, so there
was no one to whom I might mention the
fact. Certainly I had no thought of associating
the noise with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Tory arose. This time she moved
farther from the fire, walking restlessly up
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
and down toward the clearing which opened
into a dark forest of evergreens.
</p>
<p>The night was a mild summer night.
There was in the atmosphere the coolness
of the wooded places surrounding them.
</p>
<p>Her fire signals had not been observed on
either side of the hill. Tory&#8217;s impression
was that their camp of &#8220;The Eagle&#8217;s Wing&#8221;
lay to the west of the hill, although by no
means immediately below it. On the eastern
slope and nearer by was the Boy Scout camp.
This camp the girls of her own Troop had
been deliberately ignoring.
</p>
<p>At present Tory realized that she would
gladly accept aid from either or any direction.
</p>
<p>Had Kara been well and awake, or if they
had been able to dream beside one another,
the long night would have proved a delightful
experience.
</p>
<p>From the depth of the woods an owl was
crying. Tory repressed a slight shudder,
controlling her nerves by an effort. The
sound recalled the vague moaning that first
aroused her to any knowledge of Kara&#8217;s
accident. Once more she could see Kara
lying at the bottom of a tiny precipice. Her
face was covered with rocks and earth, but
there was no sign that she had fallen any distance
or been seriously hurt.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>Now in retrospection Tory could see Kara
smiling up at her in the old humorous fashion.
She could hear her voice with the gentle
drawl that had attracted her so strongly at
their original meeting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most extraordinary thing, Tory darling.
I slid off that small embankment a short
time ago, bringing most of it along with me.
I was considerably bumped and I presume
bruised, but not hurt. However, I decided
to lie still here for a while until I recovered
my nerves and disposition. Then I tried to
climb back to you for consolation and found
that my legs <i>would</i> crumple under me in the
most absurd fashion. So I fell to making
disagreeable noises so you would come and
find me. What are we going to do, Tory?
I can&#8217;t walk and I weigh too much for you
to carry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Yet she must have carried her, or else Kara
must have been able to walk a little! Somehow
they had managed to reach this clearing
nearer the summit of the hill. Here a fire
signal could be more plainly observed.
</p>
<p>Six hours had passed. Not for five minutes
had Tory allowed the fire signal to die down.
No one had replied either by another signal
or by coming to their rescue.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>Fortunately Kara slept the greater part of
the time. Now that the night was fully
advanced she would be more comfortable
where she was than carried down the mountainside,
where there was no well defined
path. One had to seek the easiest way between
the trees.
</p>
<p>For her own part Tory concluded that she
might as well attempt to sleep for as long as
her fire could be trusted to continue burning.
</p>
<p>The pine wood was filled with brush and
the night so bright she could find without
difficulty what she was seeking.
</p>
<p>Returning, Tory smothered over the fire
so that it might burn for some time without
replenishing. She then lay down beside Kara.
</p>
<p>Toward morning she must have dreamed.
She woke with the impression that a number
of years had passed, or what seemed a long
passage of time, and in the interval she and
Kara had been searching the world over for
each other and unable to meet.
</p>
<p>Glad she was to reach over and touch her
companion, who scarcely had stirred.
</p>
<p>Already the sky was streaked with light,
palest rose and blue.
</p>
<p>Strengthened and refreshed, Tory set to
work again. The summer morning was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
exquisite, the odor of the pine trees never
so fragrant, nor the air so delicious.
</p>
<p>Failing in her signals for help the evening
before, she now determined to make a more
strenuous effort. Intending to return to
camp before dusk, she and Kara had neglected
to bring a flashlight or a lantern which might
have proved more effective.
</p>
<p>With the coming of darkness she had not
relied on solid columns of black smoke being
seen at any distance. Now on a farther ridge
of the hill she arranged two such smoke
columns, remembering that two steady smokes
side by side mean &#8220;I am lost, come and
help me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>If she failed a second time, she determined
to go down the hill until she was able to
secure aid. But this meant leaving Kara
alone, which even for a short time she did
not wish to do.
</p>
<p>The waiting was the difficult task. To her
own embarrassment Tory realized that she
was thinking more of her own hunger than
of Kara&#8217;s need as the minutes wore on and
no one arrived. Fortunately she had saved
a small quantity of coffee in their thermos
bottle the day before. This must be for Kara
when she finally awakened.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>There was nothing to occupy one save to
rise now and then and stir the hot ashes to
a fresh blaze, covering them afterwards with
the green wood of the small beeches that
straggled up the hill away from the shadow
of the pines.
</p>
<p>The noise of footsteps up the mountainside
actually failed to arouse Tory until they were
not far away.
</p>
<p>She first heard an exclamation from Kara.
She had not been so sound asleep for the
past hour as she had preferred to pretend.
</p>
<p>Kara sat up, her arms outstretched as if
she were a child begging to be lifted up.
</p>
<p>Tory started toward her. She then turned
and ran forward with a cry of relief. Had
Fate allowed her to choose her own and Kara&#8217;s
rescuers she would have selected the two
figures now appearing at the brow of the
east side of the hill. They wore the uniforms
of Boy Scouts and were the brothers of one
of the girls in her own Patrol. They were also
her own intimate friends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don, Lance!&#8221; Tory exclaimed, a little
breathless and incoherent. &#8220;How in the
world did you find this impossible place?
Kara and I have been fearing we might have
to stay here always!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don held out his hand and caught Tory&#8217;s,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
giving it a reassuring pressure. He was a
big, blue-eyed fellow with fair hair and a
splendid physique.
</p>
<p>In contrast Victoria Drew appeared small
and fragile and incapable.
</p>
<p>Lance McClain was entirely unlike his
brother in appearance. He was dark and
small. He went directly to the girl who
seemed most to require his help.
</p>
<p>As she struggled to rise at his approach
and was not able, Lance knelt down on the
grass beside her, while Kara explained what
had occurred.
</p>
<p>Never, Tory Drew decided, would she forget
the aspect of their own camp in Beechwood
Forest, when an hour or more later she,
in the lead, caught the first glimpse of it. It
was as if one had struggled through one of the
circles of Purgatory to reach Paradise at last.
</p>
<p>Actually a few lines from Dante that her
father had recited many times returned to
Tory&#8217;s memory:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;My senses down, when the true path I left;</p>

</td></tr></table>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>The way had been difficult with Kara
helpless.
</p>
<p>With their arms forming a kind of basket
chair and Kara&#8217;s arms about their necks,
Donald and Lance had moved slowly down
the hillside.
</p>
<p>Once Tory became aware that Lance looked
almost as ill and exhausted as Kara herself.
</p>
<p>Don&#8217;s color continued as ruddy, his eyes
as blue and serene and his expression as
steadfast as the moment when they had set
out on the descent of the hill. To call attention
to the fact that Lance was less able to
endure the fatigue, Tory knew from past
experience would anger him.
</p>
<p>Curious that no one in their own camp
appeared to have been alarmed by their
night&#8217;s absence!
</p>
<p>The morning bugle must have sounded
more than an hour before. The early drill
was over.
</p>
<p>By the open fire Tory now beheld Dorothy
McClain and Louise Miller preparing breakfast.
</p>
<p>Placing her hands to her lips she uttered
their Scout signal call.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>LOOKING BACKWARD</h3>
</div>

<p>A few minutes later Donald and Lance
McClain were standing in the open
space before the Girl Scout camp.
They were facing a number of the girls and
their Scout Captain, Sheila Mason, as well.
</p>
<p>Slightly in the background and yet within
hearing, Victoria Drew waited.
</p>
<p>Kara was lying on the cot inside her own
tent. Tory&#8217;s friends had suggested that she
follow Kara&#8217;s example and allow breakfast
to be brought to her. Surely she looked
weary enough after a night of such anxiety!
</p>
<p>Tory had her own reasons for declining.
Now as she overheard the beginning of the
conversation she was glad of her own decision.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are sorry to have intruded upon you
even for a short time, Miss Mason,&#8221; Donald
McClain protested. &#8220;We know that you
have asked that no member of our Scout
camp come within your boundaries this summer.
Of course you appreciate that the
present circumstances left Lance and me no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
choice. Last night Lance insisted that he
saw the light from a fire on one of the hills
which he believed was a signal for help. The
rest of us talked him out of the idea. The
fire was plain enough, but we were under the
impression that some one was spending the
night on the hill-top and had kindled the
fire either for cooking or companionship.
Lance is an obstinate chap and was not
altogether convinced. He arose at dawn and
discovered the two smoke columns. He
wakened no one but me. We set out and
were lucky enough to find Tory and Kara
without much trouble. We must say good-by
to you at once. The other fellows will not
know what has become of us, as we can&#8217;t
reach our own camp for another two hours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Impulsively Tory Drew made a little forward
movement. She then observed Lance&#8217;s
eyes fastened upon her with the half-humorous,
half-quizzical expression she frequently
found annoying. What was there in the
present moment to amuse him, save her own
intention to come immediately to Donald&#8217;s
defense? He so rarely made a speech to any
stranger so long as this one to the Girl Scout
Troop Captain. When the four of them
were together, she and Dorothy McClain,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
Lance and Don, Lance often accused her of
talking for Don.
</p>
<p>At this instant, however, Sheila Mason
extended her hand toward Donald with a
friendly gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been anxious for the opportunity
to explain to you and Lance that in asking
the Boy Scouts not to pay visits to our camp
this summer, we did not intend to include
you. We have talked of this to your sister,
but Dorothy has had no opportunity, she
tells me, to speak of it to you. We realize
you could not have taken part in the rude
behavior of the other boys the night following
our making camp here at the border of
the forest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sheila Mason, the Troop Captain of the
Girl Scouts of the Eagle&#8217;s Wing, was only
about ten years older than the youngest
member of her Troop.
</p>
<p>In the early morning sunlight she looked
charming in her brown khaki skirt and white
blouse. Her long, light hair was braided close
about her small head, her fair skin tanned by
the outdoor life of the past few weeks, and
color brighter than at any time in her life.
</p>
<p>It was now midsummer, with days of
unusual heat and nights of enchanting coolness.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>There was no trace of severity in the Troop
Captain&#8217;s manner or appearance, but Donald
McClain flushed uncomfortably and closed
his lips into the obstinate lines Tory so well
recognized.
</p>
<p>She wished Dorothy for a moment would
be less faithful to her task of preparing
breakfast. Mingling with the other outdoor
fragrances, the odor of the coffee gave Tory
a sensation of momentary faintness from
sheer hunger.
</p>
<p>Don had squared his shoulders. Not sixteen,
he was nearly six feet in height and
splendidly built.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken, Miss Mason. I was
with the other Boy Scouts the night we came
over to your camp. We meant to frighten you
a little and to find out a few of the mistakes
you were pretty sure to make on your first
camping venture, nothing worse! We had
no idea you&#8217;d take a little teasing so seriously.
Some of us may not have behaved as well as
we should, but nothing for the girls to have
made a tragedy over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Donald was not intending to offend the Girl
Scout Captain more deeply, but tact was not
his strong point.
</p>
<p>Why did Lance fail to come to his brother&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
rescue? Tory flashed an indignant glance at
him. He possessed, when he wished, the
gift of expression his brother lacked. Lance&#8217;s
occasional moods of silence were due either
to disappointment or anger.
</p>
<p>Arriving a stranger in Westhaven the winter
before, among Victoria Drew&#8217;s first acquaintances
were Dorothy McClain and her six
brothers. Their father was the leading physician
in Westhaven and an old friend of her
aunt and uncle. They were neighbors as well.
</p>
<p>In the beginning Tory had believed she
preferred Lance to any of the other boys.
He was Dorothy&#8217;s favorite among her brothers,
a delicate, musical chap, partly admired and
partly scorned by the five who were stronger
and more matter of fact.
</p>
<p>Lance&#8217;s passion for music, of which he
knew but little, his desire to be left alone, his
failure in most athletic sports, the rest of his
family found annoying and amusing.
</p>
<p>Lance McClain alone was like his mother
who had died some years before, the others
like Dr. McClain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lance, why in the world don&#8217;t you help
Don out? You know he will only make
things worse if left to himself.&#8221; Tory whispered
at this moment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Want to save Don at my expense? All
right, Tory,&#8221; he answered quizzically in the
voice and manner Tory never really understood.
</p>
<p>Lance moved forward and now stood close
beside Miss Mason.
</p>
<p>His golden-brown eyes and his sensitive
mouth relieved his face from plainness, although
he was considered the least good
looking member of his family.
</p>
<p>At present he was smiling in a charming
fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Miss Mason,&#8221; he began speaking
slowly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you can imagine
what a difficult thing it is to have a brother
who is always putting you in the wrong? Oh,
not intentionally, but by everlastingly doing
the right thing and then trying to take the
blame for your mistakes!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don did not want us to come to your
camp and make a scene. He is our Patrol
leader and we should have done what he
advised. Only we wouldn&#8217;t and didn&#8217;t!
He came along at last more to keep the rest
of us out of mischief than because he wanted
to be in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance drew his brows together so they
became a fine line.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder if I&#8217;ve got to make a clean breast
of the whole business? Don is everlastingly
forcing me to play up to him when I would
not otherwise. The suggestion that we hike
over to the girls&#8217; camp and see what was
going on originated with me. Don and I had
been telling Dorothy you would never get
things in shape over here without help from
us, or men in the village. Your Girl Scout
Troop has been claiming that you could
accomplish all the things we do and a few
other things beside. We did not believe you
and wished to see for ourselves. I was sorry
and mad as Don when some of the fellows
went too far. We had a call-down from our
Captain and have been looking for a chance
to apologize. Do try and forget it, won&#8217;t you?
If your Girl Scouts will swoop down on us
unexpectedly and be double the nuisance
that we were, we are willing to call it square.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sheila Mason laughed. Margaret Hale,
the Patrol leader and one of Victoria Drew&#8217;s
intimate friends, who had joined the group
during Lance&#8217;s speech, shook her head. She
was a tall, serious looking girl with clear-cut
features and a graceful manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lance, I don&#8217;t believe a Boy Scout Troop
is supposed to employ a lawyer. You strike
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
me as a special pleader. You had better go
in for the law instead of music. We are not
so cranky that we would have objected to an
ordinary descent upon us, even with the idea
of showing us what inferior creatures we are.
But when it comes to trying to frighten us, and
some of the more timid girls were frightened,
you behaved as if you were wild Indians.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance held up a white handkerchief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a token of complete surrender.
We ask the courtesy due the defeated, Miss
Mason. Please don&#8217;t allow Margaret to rake
up the past. Don and I must be off now to
camp. Sorry you won&#8217;t give us a message
of forgiveness to carry back. May we speak
to Dorothy? Evidently she is more interested
in her breakfast than in her brothers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Lance, you and Don must have
breakfast with us before you leave,&#8221; Miss
Mason answered. &#8220;I cannot bury the hatchet,
Indian fashion, because the Girl Scouts must
decide themselves whether or not you are
forgiven.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Approaching in their direction at this
moment, her face flushed and holding a long
toasting fork in one hand, was Dorothy
McClain.
</p>
<p>She was only a year and a few months
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
younger than her two brothers and looked
very like Don, save that her hair was chestnut
and her eyes a darker blue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don, Lance, how glad I am you had the
good luck to come to Tory&#8217;s and Kara&#8217;s aid!
I have made a double amount of toast and
there are six more eggs added to our usual
supply for breakfast. I thought you would
appreciate this sisterly attention more than
rushing to greet you at once. I saw you
were not lonely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good to see you, Dot. You are looking
in great shape, only we must be off at once,&#8221;
Donald answered, still appearing uncomfortable
and obstinate.
</p>
<p>Between Dorothy and Tory Drew a signal
was flashed of which no one of the small group
save Lance McClain was aware.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please stay, Don,&#8221; Tory begged, moving
forward and standing beside him. She scarcely
came up to his shoulder. &#8220;Edith Linder has
gone to Miss Frean&#8217;s cottage to ask her to
come to Kara at once. She is to try to telephone
for your father. If not, one of us
must ride in to town for him. But perhaps
he might want you to be here when he
arrives in case there is anything to be done,
if Kara has to be lifted. Oh, I don&#8217;t know
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
anything, except that I am dreadfully worried
over her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don softened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course if there is any chance Lance
or I can be of further use we&#8217;ll be glad to
stay. You ought to go to bed, Tory, and not
wait for father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory shook her head. Her face was whiter
than usual from anxiety and fatigue, yet
Donald McClain liked her appearance.
</p>
<p>His brothers and other people might insist
there were several girls in the Girl Scout
Troop of the Eagle&#8217;s Wing far prettier than
Victoria Drew&mdash;Teresa Peterson, with her
half Italian beauty, his own sister, Dorothy,
Joan Peters, with her regular features and
patrician air. Don knew that Tory possessed
a charm and vividness, a quickness of thought
and a grace of movement more attractive to
him than ordinary beauty.
</p>
<p>Forgetting their companions, they walked
off together, leaving the others to follow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you only knew how I have been longing
to show you our camp in Beechwood Forest,
Don! Please say you think it is wonderful,&#8221;
Tory pleaded.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THEIR CAMP</h3>
</div>

<p>They were seated along the edge of the
lake, six girls and their two visitors.
The water was a still, dim blue
reflection of the sky with one deep shadow
from the hill of pines. Away from the hill
and the lake stood the forest of beechwood
trees.
</p>
<p>In an open space on a little rise of ground
half within, half without the forest, lay the
summer camp of the Girl Scouts of the Eagle&#8217;s
Wing.
</p>
<p>A little brown house built of logs was almost
entirely covered with vines, a tangle of woodbine
and honeysuckle and wistaria. Only
from the windows and the door had the vines
been cut away. The house looked extremely
ancient, older than the slender beeches that
formed a semicircle to the rear and left.
Beyond the door, thick with deep green shade
on this midsummer morning, towered a single
giant beech which appeared to have moved
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
out a few yards from its forest shelter to act
as a sentinel for the log cabin.
</p>
<p>The cabin had been erected so many years
before that no one in the vicinity remembered
its origin. Finding the location an ideal one
for their camp, the little house had been
restored, the chimney to the single fireplace
made over, the glass added to the window
frames, open spaces between the logs replastered.
</p>
<p>The log house formed the center of the
camp.
</p>
<p>On each side at irregular distances were
three tents, one row advancing from the forest,
the other receding into it.
</p>
<p>To-day there was an unusual stillness about
the camp itself at an hour of the morning
ordinarily a busy and active one.
</p>
<p>Now and then some one appeared, hastily
accomplished whatever the task and vanished.
</p>
<p>Even the little group on the shore of the
lake continued unusually quiet. When any
one did speak it was with a lowered voice.
</p>
<p>Five of the six girls were occupied. Only
Tory Drew&#8217;s hands were idle. They moved
frequently with unconscious gestures characteristic
of her temperament and the fact
that she had lived a number of years in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
Latin countries where the hands are used to
communicate one&#8217;s meaning as well as speech.
</p>
<p>She made a sweeping movement of her
hand at this instant, appearing to include the
lake, forest, hillside and the small group of
tents about the evergreen cabin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have not yet said, Don, that you
consider our camp superior to yours, when
I am perfectly convinced that it is, without
having laid eyes on yours. Lance has given
me the impression that he agrees with me.
He has not exactly said so in any words I
can recall, but he can be tactful when he
likes. You are always so tiresomely silent,
Don, whether you think a thing true or not
true. I always know when you are most
silent your opinion is the strongest one way
or the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Don was silent. Yet he knew the group of
girls were awaiting his reply with almost as
great interest as Tory.
</p>
<p>Finally he smiled in a handsome, good-humored
fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t see why you should object to my
not talking a great deal, Tory, when it gives
you and Dorothy and Lance more opportunity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned around, however, studying the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
little camp in the shadow of the old forest with
careful scrutiny. Donald McClain did not
think quickly nor could he express his point
of view until he had given a subject serious
consideration.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any comparison between your
Girl Scout camp and our own, Tory,&#8221; he
returned at length. &#8220;The two camps are
not in the least alike. In the first place, you
tell me that you have only fourteen Girl
Scouts and we have nearly forty boys. Of
course things look neater and more picturesque
here, with girls one expects this. Our
problem is different. I have an idea we have
more discipline and do more hard work.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory Drew looked annoyed.
</p>
<p>Dorothy McClain took up the defense.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not so sure of the work and the discipline,
Don. We do everything at our camp,
the cooking, washing and cleaning. We have
been pretending that we were members of
Penelope&#8217;s household. If you have never
read the &#8216;Odyssey&#8217; you won&#8217;t know what I am
talking about. Joan Peters we sometimes
call Penelope. She is everlastingly at her
weaving, but does not unravel her web at
night that she has woven in the daytime.
She is not troubled by Penelope&#8217;s importunate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
suitors. Tory at present is the Princess
Nausicaa, the daughter of the King Alcinous,
who conducts the family washing as a part
of her work. I won&#8217;t bore you with all our
distinguished titles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As for discipline! I don&#8217;t mean to be rude
and I am glad you did not wish your Troop
of Scouts to descend upon us like a band of
Indians on a group of pioneer women. Still,
I would scarcely be proud of such discipline.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Dorothy, what is the use? You
know you are reflecting upon me, not upon
old Don. But with my well-known amiability
I forgive you. Whose idea was it that you
pretend to be Greek heroines as well as American
Girl Scouts?&#8221; Lance inquired in the tone
that nearly always brought peace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we have not gone into the idea
seriously,&#8221; Joan Peters returned. Her head
was bent over the square frame she held in
her lap, her fingers busy with the strands of
flax. &#8220;Miss Frean comes to camp every
few evenings and reads aloud to us. She
insists that we are too frivolous in our own
summer reading and wishes to read us something
we ought to remember.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan Peters liked Lance McClain. She was
a great reader and perhaps because of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
more delicate health Lance did not feel the
same scorn of books that Donald affected.
</p>
<p>With a swift movement Tory arose suddenly.
Apparently she forgot the group of
friends close about her. She clasped her
hands tightly together, her eyes suddenly
looked larger and darker, her lips twitched.
</p>
<p>The Girl Scouts of the Eagle&#8217;s Wing had
chosen silver and gold as their camp colors.
</p>
<p>Near the spot where Tory was standing lay
two canoes. One was golden in color with
an eagle&#8217;s wing in silver on the bow, the other
the opposite color scheme. Tory&#8217;s own khaki
costume looked golden in the sunlight. The
water was now silver.
</p>
<p>Don had a fleeting impression that Tory
intended to jump into one of the canoes and
disappear from sight.
</p>
<p>Now and then she affected him curiously.
He never knew what she intended to do or say.
She thought so quickly, moved so swiftly,
and he was stupid and slow.
</p>
<p>At the present moment he was puzzled and
troubled by her sudden look of intense
unhappiness. The instant before she had
been arguing the respective merits of the
two camps and had appeared cheerful as usual.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter, Tory? You are the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
most startling person! You upset one,&#8221;
Teresa Peterson protested.
</p>
<p>She glanced toward Donald and then
toward Lance McClain for their attention or
approval.
</p>
<p>Teresa was unlike the other Girl Scouts.
She was extremely pretty with dusky hair
that curled about a low forehead and soft
rose colored cheeks. She gave one an impression
of sweetness and yet one could not be
sure of her actual character. She seemed
always anxious for attention and the approval
of other people. Several of the girls in her
Patrol felt that Teresa was unnecessarily
self-conscious before a masculine audience.
</p>
<p>At this instant Tory Drew returned her
glance. Her face showed bewilderment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Teresa, how can you ask what is
troubling me? Is one of us thinking any
other thought? Of course we have had to
talk of other things, but nothing matters
except what Dr. McClain may at this moment
be deciding about Kara. You know we all
care for her more than any other girl at camp.
She has had so much more to contend with
than the rest of us even before this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She thought first of our camp in Beechwood
Forest and we used to talk of it when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
it did not seem a possibility. The day of her
accident Kara told me the past few weeks
had been the happiest of her life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory walked away from the others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been trying to keep my word and
stay here with you until after Dr. McClain
had seen Kara. Now I cannot wait any
longer. I am sure something more dreadful
than any of us realize has happened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Margaret Hale rose and slipped her arm
inside the other girl&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go back together. You are more
nervous over Kara than need be because of
the strain of last night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They moved on a few yards.
</p>
<p>Coming out of the cabin they could see
Dr. McClain, Miss Frean and Sheila Mason.
Dr. McClain, assisted by the two women, was
bearing Kara in his arms.
</p>
<p>Before Margaret and Tory reached them,
he had placed Kara in his motor car and they
were driving away.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>RIGHT ABOUT, FACE</h3>
</div>

<p>Tory toiled up the long, hot street,
her arms filled with packages, her
face flushed.
</p>
<p>How different the atmosphere from the
cool green shade of Beechwood Forest!
</p>
<p>At the end of the street upon a rise of
ground stood the Old Gray House. This had
been Katherine Moore&#8217;s name for the house,
accepted and used by the town of Westhaven.
To-day it appeared what it actually was:
the village orphan asylum.
</p>
<p>No longer could Kara&#8217;s optimism conceal
reality from Victoria Drew.
</p>
<p>The house showed blistered and bare of
paint. The open space of yard, green and
fresh in the springtime, when she and Kara
oftentimes sat outdoors to dream and plan,
was now baked brown and sere.
</p>
<p>The children playing in the yard behind the
tall iron fence looked tired and cross, a little
like prisoners to Tory&#8217;s present state of mind.
</p>
<p>She had come in from camp early in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
day and had spent several hours at home with
her uncle, Mr. Richard Fenton. Their own
house was empty save for his presence. Miss
Victoria had gone for a month&#8217;s holiday to
the sea.
</p>
<p>After a talk with her uncle and an hour&#8217;s
shopping, she was now on her way to call
upon Kara.
</p>
<p>She saw a mental picture of Kara&#8217;s small
room on the top floor of the Gray House.
How proud Kara had been because she need
share her room with no one!
</p>
<p>And what a place to be shut up in when one
was ill!
</p>
<p>For Kara&#8217;s sake Tory had endeavored to
view this room with Kara&#8217;s eyes. Kara loved
it and the old Gray House that had sheltered
her since babyhood, her refuge when apparently
deserted by the parents she had never
known.
</p>
<p>Victoria Drew was an artist. This did
not mean that necessarily she was possessed
of an artist&#8217;s talent, but of the artist&#8217;s temperament.
Besides, had she not lived with
her artist father wandering about the most
beautiful countries in Europe<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> until her
arrival in Westhaven the winter before?
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>If this temperament oftentimes allowed Tory
to color humdrumness with rose, it also gave
her a sensitive distaste to what other people
might not feel so intensely.
</p>
<p>With half a dozen of the children in the
yard of the Gray House, Tory now stopped
to talk a few moments. Never before could
she recall wanting to see Kara so much and
so little at the same time.
</p>
<p>Of the two children who had been Kara&#8217;s
special charges and her own favorites, only
the boy remained.
</p>
<p>His eyes bluer and more wistful than formerly,
Billy Duncan came forward to speak
to Tory.
</p>
<p>He seemed older and thinner and less the
cherub she remembered.
</p>
<p>The children who were his playmates could
have told her that Billy had altered since the
departure of his adored companion, Lucy
Martin, the little girl who had been adopted
by Mr. and Mrs. Jeremy Hammond a few
months before.
</p>
<p>Lucy Martin had been an odd little girl,
full of fire and passion and wilfulness. Blindly
and adoringly Billy had followed her until
her departure from the Gray House.
</p>
<p>Afterwards he never spoke of her or asked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
for her, although at first she often demanded
his presence and came to the Gray House to
see him. Of late, however, Lucy had ceased
to appear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you miss Lucy?&#8221; Tory inquired at this
instant and was sorry for her own stupidity.
</p>
<p>Billy merely shook his head. He always
had been a dull little boy. One had been
fond of him because of his sweetness and
placidity, not for any brilliance.
</p>
<p>Slipping a gift inside Billy&#8217;s pockets, Tory
ran on up to the Gray House, comforting
herself with the idea that the little boy was
incapable of feeling anything deeply.
</p>
<p>The fact that Lucy had lost her affection
for Kara, who had been like a devoted older
sister, was more serious.
</p>
<p>The door stood open so that Tory entered
the wide hall of the old house without ringing
the bell. She had come often enough during
the past winter and spring to be a privileged
character.
</p>
<p>At the bottom of the long flight of stairs
she paused a moment. Warm and out of
breath, she did not wish Kara to guess at her
rebellious mood when she arrived at the little
room up under the eaves.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t find Kara upstairs in her old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
room. Let me show you where she is,&#8221; a
voice called, as Tory placed her foot on the
first stair.
</p>
<p>The big room had been a back parlor in
the days when the Gray House had been the
residence of a prosperous farmer. This was
before the village of Westhaven had drawn
so close to it.
</p>
<p>By the window in a wheeled chair sat a
small figure crouched so low that had she not
known it could be no one else, Tory would
scarcely have recognized her.
</p>
<p>Since her night and Kara&#8217;s together on the
hillside only a week had gone by. Could one
week have altered Kara&#8217;s appearance and
her nature?
</p>
<p>Her impulse to go toward the figure and
gather her in her arms, Tory carefully repressed.
</p>
<p>Kara&#8217;s expression, as she raised her eyes at
her approach, was almost forbidding.
</p>
<p>Tory also repressed the exclamation that
rose to her lips.
</p>
<p>How white and thin the other girl&#8217;s face
appeared! The humorous, gayly challenging
look with which she had met former trials
and difficulties had vanished. The lines of
Kara&#8217;s mouth were tired and old, the gray
eyes with the long dark lashes, her one claim
to beauty, were dark and rebellious.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have taken your own time to come
to see me, Tory. I have been here at the
orphan asylum nearly a week and this is the
first time you or any member of my Girl
Scout Patrol has honored me with a call. I
can&#8217;t say I altogether blame you. It certainly
is pleasanter at our camp in Beechwood
Forest than in this place!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory&#8217;s arms went around Kara&#8217;s shoulders,
her bright red lips touched the other girl&#8217;s
brown hair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I have wanted to come to you
every minute in the twenty-four hours, dear,
and every member of your Patrol has wanted
to come as well, besides Miss Mason and
Miss Frean and all the rest. To-day I am
regarded as the most privileged person in the
camp because I am first to see you. Dr.
McClain only consented last night to allow
me to come. I am to bring you everybody&#8217;s
love and to demand that you stay away from
camp only the shortest time. Otherwise we
intend to call on Dr. McClain in a body and
assert our authority as Girl Scouts to bring
you home to Beechwood Forest. Anyone
save a doctor would know you would sooner
grow strong again there than here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As she talked, partly as a relief from nervousness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
and to hide her consternation over
Kara&#8217;s changed appearance, Tory was moving
about the room arranging her gifts.
</p>
<p>In a vase filled with water from a pitcher
standing on a table she placed a bouquet of
faded wild flowers.
</p>
<p>The room became fragrant with the scent
of wild hyacinths, ragged robins, cornflowers
and daisies. By a low bowl piled with peaches
and grapes, she put two magazines and a new
book.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Richard sent you the things to read,
Kara. I should like to have brought more,
but could not manage to carry them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Still Kara made no reply. She scarcely had
glanced at the offerings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry the flowers are so faded. I think
they will look better after a time. I had not
the cruelty to decline to bring them, as Edith
Linder and Teresa Peterson rose up this
morning and gathered them in the dew to
send you. I have brought our camp log for
the past week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Conscious of the wall between herself and
her companion, Tory was aware that she was
talking of trivialities until the moment when
Kara would admit her inside her closed
citadel.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>How long before she would speak a second
time?
</p>
<p>Walking over toward Kara, Tory took a
low seat beside the wheeled chair.
</p>
<p>With a swift gesture of affection she placed
a square book on Kara&#8217;s lap. The book was
of heavy paper, golden in color back and front
and with silver-gray leaves inside. On the outside
cover was a painting of an eagle&#8217;s wing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first time we have ever had a
written history of our week at camp, Kara
dear. But we decided the other night at our
Troop meeting to arrange this to bring to you.
So whatever we dropped into the big box in
front of Miss Mason&#8217;s tent we put inside this
book. I have made some sketches and Joan
Peters has written a poem dedicated to you.
Please look for yourself, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kara turned away her eyes.
</p>
<p>Still Tory had no sensation of anger, only
a kind of nervous fear. More than any one
who ever knew her could have imagined here
was a different Kara!
</p>
<p>She now pushed aside the little magazine
with a gesture of annoyance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know what you have been
doing at camp, Tory. I never want to hear
any mention of our Girl Scouts again. You
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
must erase my name from our Patrol list and
find some one else to fill my place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A valiant effort, Tory&#8217;s to smile, when in
the other girl&#8217;s voice and manner there was
so much to make smiling difficult.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When that day arrives, Kara, I presume
I also shall wish to resign from the Girl
Scouts. It is hard to imagine when we both
care so deeply. Has anyone or anything
offended you? Do you feel I am responsible
for your accident? If you realized how many
times during the past week I have wondered
if this were true. I did ask Miss Mason for
permission to allow us to go for the day alone.
I told her that I could sketch so much better
without any companion save you. She reproaches
herself now as much as I do and
says as our Troop Captain the mistake was
hers. But we promised not to go far from
camp and were accustomed to the neighborhood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be stupid, Tory. I have not forgotten
that I first suggested the plan to you.
We wanted a day to ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kara had spoken. At least this much had
been accomplished, although her tone remained
hard and uninterested.
</p>
<p>Suddenly her head went down until her
face was hidden.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know, Tory, darling? Has no
one told you or the other Girl Scouts of our
Troop? Dr. McClain promised me that he
would tell you. I can&#8217;t come back to our
camp in Beechwood Forest, I cannot be a
Girl Scout. I may never be able to walk
again. No, I do not suffer, I never have
suffered, that is the dreadful part of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kara&#8217;s hands now clutched the other girl&#8217;s
shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tory, don&#8217;t look at me like that. It may
not be true always.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A DISCUSSION</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The land that is always afternoon,&#8221;
Joan Peters quoted dreamily.
</p>
<p>Twelve girls were seated in a circle
in a clearing in Beechwood Forest. Save for
the fact that fallen logs formed their resting
place here was a modern American &#8220;Agora of
Mycanae,&#8221; the well polished circle of stones,
where the earliest of civilized peoples sat for
council and judgment.
</p>
<p>The afternoon sunlight slanted through the
deep polished green of the trees.
</p>
<p>A few moments before, the other girls had
been earnestly talking, then had ensued a
thoughtful silence and Jean&#8217;s irrelevant speech.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never have understood exactly what that
expression means, but it always has had a
fascination for me,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Please
don&#8217;t think I am forgetting what we have
been discussing this last hour. To my mind
there can be no two ways of looking at it.
The only problem we have is Kara. And,
thank goodness, we do not have to decide
what is wisest and best for her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>Seated beside Joan, Tory Drew remained
oddly still. Quiet either of body or mind was
an unusual phase with her. Life and movement
were her natural characteristics, more
marked than with most girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could think as Joan does, that
the decision does not rest with us and we <i>must</i>
be content,&#8221; she added finally. &#8220;I feel as if I
<i>knew</i> it was the only thing for Kara to come
back to us and as if no one and nothing could
induce me to think otherwise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a very sensible point of view, Victoria,&#8221;
a voice answered.
</p>
<p>In the tone there was a different enunciation.
In the voice there was a different emphasis
from the other Girl Scouts. Besides, no one
of them ever spoke to Tory without using her
abbreviated title.
</p>
<p>The girl who had made the remark was
different in manner, appearance and costume
from the rest of the group, although not conspicuously
so. Martha Greaves was an
English girl who had crossed the ocean early
in the summer with Tory Drew&#8217;s father and
step-mother to spend the summer in Westhaven.
She was singularly tall with light
brown hair and gray-blue eyes.
</p>
<p>After she had spoken she appeared a little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
embarrassed as if she regretted having called
the attention of the other girls to her presence.
</p>
<p>At the beginning of their acquaintance
Martha and Tory had felt drawn toward
each other. The differences in their temperaments
appeared not as a barrier, but an
interest.
</p>
<p>But with the opening of the camp in
Beechwood Forest, Tory had neglected her
responsibilities. Her affection for Katherine
Moore had made her less mindful than she
should have been of a stranger in a new
environment.
</p>
<p>Fortunately Martha Greaves was an English
Girl Guide. She was wearing the uniform of
the Guides at this moment. Shy she might
appear upon suddenly expressing her opinion,
yet assuredly she had made a number of
friends among the Girl Scouts. Moreover,
she was too vitally interested in the differences
between the two organizations, the Girl
Guides of England and the Girl Scouts of the
United States, to be especially self conscious.
</p>
<p>She understood and liked Tory&#8217;s impulsive
nature with its capacity for romantic affection,
so unlike her own. She considered herself to
be a matter-of-fact person with only a few
enthusiasms.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>At Martha&#8217;s sensible statement Tory had
the sensation of being suddenly plunged into
cold water.
</p>
<p>A moment she was nonplussed and slightly
angry. Then she had the good sense to realize
that Martha had not intended to be unkind.
What she had said was undoubtedly true.
</p>
<p>If she were rarely sensible at any time, Tory
appreciated that she had become less so since
her last talk with Kara.
</p>
<p>Not an hour since had the problem of Kara
been out of her mind.
</p>
<p>Indeed, since the news of the result of what
had first seemed a simple accident had reached
the camp of the Girl Scouts in Beechwood
Forest, the entire summer to which they had
looked forward so joyously seemed to offer
only disappointment.
</p>
<p>They were only fourteen in number and
Kara was individually dear to each one of
them. Seven of the group were in Kara&#8217;s
own Patrol, the others, members of her Troop
of the Eagle&#8217;s Wing.
</p>
<p>If they suffered some disadvantages over
the larger summer camps for girls they had
the advantage of a peculiar and intimate
feeling for one another. The fact that Martha
Greaves was the one outsider added a special
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
interest. Rarely a half day passed that one
of the Girl Scouts did not make some inquiry
of Martha concerning their respective organizations.
</p>
<p>She was glad enough to answer and they
were learning from each other.
</p>
<p>The Girl Scouts of the Eagle&#8217;s Wing had
worked at their scouting during the past
winter with pleasure and faith, but occasional
meetings could not bring the results these past
few magical weeks at camp had accomplished.
</p>
<p>All day long they were outdoors, at night
the tent flaps were oftentimes left open for a
better view of the sky and the feel of the wind.
</p>
<p>All their own work had they undertaken
and life had never appeared more practical,
simple and delightful.
</p>
<p>Then like a cloud darkening the serenity of
their summer had come the news of Katherine
Moore&#8217;s accident with its unexpected, tragic
result.
</p>
<p>Tory Drew sighed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are probably right, Martha. I have
been told often enough by Aunt Victoria and
sometimes by Kara herself that I have too
great an opinion of my own judgment, when
in reality my judgment isn&#8217;t very good.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet this time I simply can&#8217;t feel that I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
am mistaken. Kara will be happier here at
camp with us than at the Gray House or in
a sanitarium. We all understand her and
will do anything in the world to make her
happier. Dr. McClain says that Kara&#8217;s state
of mind worries him a great deal. Yet how
can it be different? Surely we can make her
physically comfortable in the evergreen house
and all of us will wish to wait on her. I&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory hesitated and could not go on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with you entirely, Tory,&#8221; Margaret
Hale answered sympathetically. Tory&#8217;s
Patrol leader, a dignified girl of gentle breeding,
she was not the most gifted member of
the Patrol, yet possessed the greatest personal
influence. One could always trust to
Margaret&#8217;s sense of justice. She was never
prejudiced and never unfair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as Tory does. If there is nothing
the doctors can do for Kara at present, save
to watch her carefully, she had far better be
here with us. I know they will do everything
that is possible at the Gray House; I know too
that Mr. Fenton has offered to pay Kara&#8217;s
expenses should the doctors decide she had
best go to a sanitarium. Yet will either of
these places alter Kara&#8217;s state of mind?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since Tory told us of her talk with Kara
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
I have scarcely been able to think of anything
else. Kara, with her optimism and humor
vanished; Kara, hard and bitter and wretched!
It seems so incredible! Why, she has always
faced her difficult existence with such courage.
When one thinks of Kara it is to recall the
humorous expression of her eyes, the laughter
that always was waiting its chance. No one
ever had so gay a laugh as Kara!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Unconscious of what she was doing, at this
instant Tory jumped up. Leaving her seat
she stood alone in the center of the circle
looking toward the other girls.
</p>
<p>The first rays of the sunset slanted through
the trees, turning the green to gold. One ray
fell directly upon Tory Drew, her bright, red-gold
hair, her thin, eager face and graceful
figure.
</p>
<p>About her the other girls were more in
darkness.
</p>
<p>There was almost a mystic quality in the
late afternoon atmosphere, here in the heart
of an ancient woods, with no one near save
the circle of Girl Scouts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Margaret has suggested just what I want
to make clear to all of you. The old Kara for
the time being seems to have disappeared.
And perhaps for the reasons Margaret has
mentioned.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Kara has had too much to bear. She
has always made the best of the fact that she
had no parents, no family! Cleverer and
sweeter than anyone, she was found in a
deserted house with no explanation as to
why she had been left there.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kara found happiness in the life at the
Gray House because everybody cared for her
at the asylum and in the village. But she
was always thinking that the day was coming
when she would be able to earn her own living
at some congenial work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Kara told me the other day that this
hope has been taken from her and she sees
nothing left. I am frightened about her.
The doctors tell her she may walk again some
day, but not for a long time. She insists this
is only to encourage her. If we, her own
Troop of Girl Scouts, can do nothing for her,
I don&#8217;t see who can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Louise Miller, seated beside her most intimate
friend, Dorothy McClain, uttered an
unexpected exclamation.
</p>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances she talked
less than any one of her companions. Usually
it was conceded that Louise alone among all
of them thought of what she was going to say
before making a remark.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>She was not good looking. Her features
were heavy and she had grown too rapidly.
She had peculiar light gray eyes under thick
dark brows which held a kind of fascination.
Yet Louise&#8217;s only real claim to beauty was
a mass of coppery, red-brown hair.
</p>
<p>She was not happy or congenial with her
own family. They were poor and her mother,
a pretty woman, resented Louise&#8217;s lack of
beauty as well as their poverty. On Louise&#8217;s
part there was no effort to conceal the fact
that she had been happier these past weeks
at their Girl Scout camp in Beechwood Forest
than at any time since she could remember.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something to be considered in this
situation beside Kara,&#8221; she began, with a kind
of awkward earnestness. The statement had
not a happy sound, but the other girls waited,
knowing that Louise had an odd fashion of
expressing herself. One could not at first be
altogether sure of her meaning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must remember that it is not for
Kara&#8217;s sake only that we are to keep her here,
if Dr. McClain agrees it will be wise, but for
our own sakes as well. While Tory has been
talking I have been wondering if we were
equal, as Girl Scouts, to the test.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look surprised, Tory, as if there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
could be no question save the joy of having
Kara to take care of and her pleasure in being
with us. There will be other sides to it.
Some one of us will always have to stay with
Kara day and night. She must never be left
alone for any length of time, when we may
be wanting to go off together on a hike or a
swimming party. It may be hard now and
then to be left out. We must not expect
Kara always to be cheerful and patient.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Louise had been looking toward Tory Drew.
She now turned her head and her glance
traveled from one face to the other.
</p>
<p>The group of girls, except for a few additional
ones, was the same that had gathered
in the old Fenton home in Westhaven on a
momentous evening the winter before.
</p>
<p>On that evening they had formed the first
Patrol of the Girl Scouts of the Eagle&#8217;s Wing
Troop. Margaret Hale remained the Patrol
Leader and Dorothy McClain her Corporal.
The other girls were Victoria Drew, Joan
Peters, Louise Miller, Teresa Peterson and
Katherine Moore. Edith Linder had been
asked later to become the eighth member and
so complete the favored number.
</p>
<p>To-day, amid the outdoor council in the
woods, there were four girls from a second
Patrol in the same Girl Scout Troop.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Honor, loyalty, duty, a sister to every
other Girl Scout, courtesy, cheerfulness. These
are some of our Scout principles. I wonder
if bringing Katherine Moore here as an
invalid to be cared for by us would not put
our Scout principles into a crucible?&#8221; one of
the four remarked unexpectedly.
</p>
<p>Tory Drew frowned upon her, and then
realizing the truth of what she had said, her
expression changed and she nodded agreement.
</p>
<p>Why should she expect that all the other
girls must appreciate as she did the degree of
Kara&#8217;s misfortune and the necessity to do
something to make her lot easier without
delay.
</p>
<p>The girl she was looking down upon always
had amused Kara and herself. She was so
unlike any of them. Her light hair was
almost as short as a boy&#8217;s and was boyish in
appearance, save that it curled in an almost
babyish fashion. Her eyes were wide open
and a light china blue. Here her doll-like
attributes ended. She had a short, determined
nose, a square chin, and a large mouth
filled with small, even teeth.
</p>
<p>She had an odd, boyish name as well, Evan
Phillips. No one knew a great deal about
her. She had come with her mother to live
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
in Westhaven the winter before in order to
go to school. She had spoken of living in
California before that time. A member of a
Girl Scout Patrol in the west, she had asked
to be admitted into the Eagle&#8217;s Wing Troop
in Westhaven.
</p>
<p>The three other members of the second
Patrol were Julia and Frances Murray and
Ann Fletcher.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is a crucible, Evan?&#8221; Tory inquired.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t care in the least how many of our
Scout principles are cast into it, if only Kara
is here at camp with us. I know what Louise
means, but no one need be troubled. If Kara
will permit it, I shall wish to be with her
always.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will not be allowed, Tory. Remember,
Kara is our friend as well as yours, and
we have known her longer,&#8221; Dorothy McClain
and the other girls protested, almost in the
same words and at the same instant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you do not argue any more for
the present,&#8221; a quiet voice interrupted, the
same voice that so often gave Tory the sensation
that she had been quietly and politely
restrained from too great intensity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure I hear some one coming, three
people in fact.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>It was slightly annoying to the American
Girl Scouts that in many ways their English
guest had a better outdoor training than any
one of them. However, this was not her
first camping experience.
</p>
<p>A moment or so later Dr. McClain appeared
at an opening between two of the trees in the
encircling grove. He was accompanied by
Sheila Mason and Miss Frean. The two
women remained outside. Alone Dr. McClain
entered the charmed circle. At once a dozen
girls were crowding about him.
</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour after Tory Drew and
Dorothy McClain were walking with him
toward the road that led back into Westhaven.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will have the little evergreen house
made comfortable for Kara. Miss Mason and
all of us have decided she will be safer and
easier to care for there than in one of the
tents. You are sure it will be best for her?
She must become stronger and in better
spirits being with us,&#8221; Dorothy McClain
insisted, clinging to her father&#8217;s arm as if
she were unwilling to let him go. &#8220;I declare
it is wonderful to have a Girl Scout doctor&mdash;father!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dr. McClain made a sound half pleasure,
half displeasure.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So this is what I have come to after more
than a quarter of a century of hard work, a
Girl Scout Doctor! Hope you girls may have
no further need for me. Hard luck about little
Kara. Things may turn out better for her
later on. By the way, you and Tory do not
know, and perhaps had best not mention it,
but the very log cabin where you are planning
to install Kara is the house where the child
was found deserted years ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But gracious, Dr. McClain!&#8221; Tory argued,
&#8220;I have always been told that Kara was found
in a deserted <i>farmhouse</i>. Our evergreen cabin
was never a farmhouse. Mr. Hammond once
spoke of finding Kara when I was with them,
and he was not aware that Kara was the child
he had discovered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Jeremy Hammond does not know a
farmhouse when he sees one. The house was
a deserted hut in those days where no one
had lived for a great many years. That is
why the mystery was the greater. A bridle
path then led past the door and joined a
road that was a short cut into Westhaven.
The path is now overgrown with grass.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember very well, because I came out
myself next day to see if Hammond, who was
a young fellow, may have overlooked any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
method by which we might trace Kara&#8217;s history.
Save for the piece of paper pinned to
the child&#8217;s dress and bearing her name no
other information was ever forthcoming. Good-by,
here is my car waiting. I&#8217;ll bring Kara
out myself in a few days. Remember, this is
only to be an experiment. If she is not happier
and does not improve we must try something
else. Much depends upon you. &#8216;Be
Prepared&#8217;.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;THE CHOROS&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>In the open space a solitary figure was
dancing.
</p>
<p>The enclosure was not the circular
place where the Girl Scouts held their councils,
but deeper in the woods, although not a great
distance away.
</p>
<p>The space was larger. Instead of being
surrounded by giant beech trees, a new grove
of young beeches was here growing up to take
the places of older trees that had died or
been cut down. Their slender trunks were
high and arched, their branches curved downward.
They seemed to stoop, as young things
that have grown too tall for their own strength.
The green of their leaves was paler and more
transparent. Underneath the trees the ground
was covered with a finer, softer grass.
</p>
<p>The girl was dancing barefoot. She wore
a thin white dress. On the ground not far
away was the khaki costume which she must
have discarded for the time being.
</p>
<p>Her hair was short and fair, and she had a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
square, determined, lightly freckled face. She
was short and her figure not particularly
graceful in repose. Watching her dancing
one thought of neither of these things. The
square head with the light fringe of curling
hair was perfectly poised, the body showed
strength and lightness.
</p>
<p>At this moment the girl was moving in a
wide circle inside the fringe of young beeches.
Her arms were extended above her head; at
regular intervals she poised and stood upon
her toes, then danced more rapidly. At
length, with a little fluttering movement like
a swallow about to alight, she dropped on the
grass, her arms covering her head.
</p>
<p>From a short distance away came exclamations
of pleasure.
</p>
<p>Stiffening with surprise, anger, and what
might have been alarm, the small figure arose.
</p>
<p>Tory Drew, pushing a wheeled chair with
a good deal of difficulty, slowly advanced.
Seated in the chair was Katherine Moore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Evan, I am sorry we have intruded upon
you and stopped your dance. It did not
occur to me until this moment that you did
not hear us approaching. Kara was bored and
I thought if I could manage we would come
down here to our &#8216;Choros.&#8217; Isn&#8217;t it learned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
to have called our dancing ground by the
name of the first dancing grounds ever discovered
and built by Daedalus, the famous
artificer of Crete? However, we are obliged
to give Miss Frean the credit for most of our
erudition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go on again to the lake as soon as
I have rested a little. May I say that it
was wonderful to see you? I did not dream
that any one of our Girl Scout Troop could
dance as you do. I am sure Kara must have
enjoyed watching you. So you will forgive
my not having told you we were near.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl in the wheeled chair lifted her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder, Tory, why you think I enjoy
seeing another person dance? Isn&#8217;t it hard
enough to sit everlastingly watching you
walking, swimming, doing whatever you wish,
while I am more helpless than a baby?
Naturally it affords me <i>especial</i> joy to behold
another girl who can do all these other things
and dance like a wood nymph besides!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the young voice there was a note that
made her companions stare helplessly toward
her and then drop their eyes as if they were
responsible and ashamed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kara, dear, it is my fault. Things always
seem to be my fault, I am so stupid these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
days! I never realized that you would mind
the dancing. I had forgotten how much you
used to care for dancing. Besides, I did not
suppose we would find any one here, and
thought we could enjoy the cool and the quiet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, Evan. You <i>are</i> a wood nymph.
Kara was right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory had placed her hands on the back of
the wheeled chair and was about to move
on, when again a querulous voice interrupted:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, let us not go at once. You are
always tiring yourself to death for me these
days. Don&#8217;t think I never overhear Miss
Mason and the other girls speaking of it,
Tory. One learns to hear more than one
should in my position. I was not always an
eavesdropper. Neither did I suppose you
would have to be a martyr for my sake, Tory.
I wish you would try not to be; a martyr is
a noble character, but one does not wish one
for a constant companion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory Drew made no reply. Instead she
shoved the heavy chair into a cool, green shelter
and dropped down on the ground beside it.
</p>
<p>The other girl followed, anxious to be
useful and not knowing what she should do.
</p>
<p>A week had passed since Kara&#8217;s return to
her friends in their Girl Scout camp in Beechwood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
Forest. The Kara who had gone away
after her accident and the Kara who had come
back seemed two utterly different human
beings.
</p>
<p>The courageous, gay, sweet-tempered girl
was now rebellious, fretful, impatient. Indeed,
she had become more difficult than any one
who had known her previously could have
imagined.
</p>
<p>The little group of Girl Scouts were being
tested, and more than any one of them, Tory
Drew. So far not once had she faltered.
Knowing Tory six months before, one could
scarcely have believed this possible. Always
she had been sweet and charming, but self
centered and spoiled. Now, was it her affection
for Katherine Moore or the months of
her Scout training that had given her a new
spirit?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you tell us how you learned to
dance in that beautiful fashion, Evan? Then,
if Kara wishes, perhaps you will dance for
us again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl with the odd, boyish name gazed
at Tory Drew reflectively. Since their arrival
in camp she had conceived a deep admiration
for Tory. She had never spoken of it to any
human being. Tory possessed this charm, of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
which she was unconscious, which was to
gain her friends all her life.
</p>
<p>Evan sat down on the ground nearby.
</p>
<p>She was a year younger than the other two
girls. At this moment, in her shabby, simple
white dress, she appeared a good deal younger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you really like to know about my
dancing? I have been wanting to tell some
one. It would be absurd to pretend I had not
been taught, no one with any judgment
would believe me. Besides, when one is a
Girl Scout I do not think one desires to keep
secrets from the other girls. Perhaps you
won&#8217;t approve of me afterwards, but I shall
run that risk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a dear! I approve of nearly
every one. What could there be to object
to in your wonderful dancing? Don&#8217;t you
know every girl who sees you must envy you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A little fearfully Tory glanced upward
toward Kara.
</p>
<p>Had she been tactless again? Everything
she said or did appeared the wrong thing
these days.
</p>
<p>At present apparently Kara was not looking
or listening to either of them. Her gray
eyes, which showed so wistfully in her thin
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
face, were fixed on a far-off line of the sky
between two clumps of trees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you might as well hear the worst at
the start,&#8221; Evan went on, smiling and revealing
her small, even teeth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, I received my ridiculous
name because my father died a short time
after I was born. It was intended I should
be a boy, so I was named for him. We were
poor and mother had to make her own living
and mine. She did not feel troubled over this
because she had studied dancing and loved
it. So she gave dancing lessons in California,
and before I was two years old I was a member
of her class. We never would have stopped
save that mother was ill and we were forced
to come east to consult a doctor. We came
to Westhaven to live so she could be near
New York and I at school. Mother is better,
and next winter intends to begin teaching
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you wish to be a dancing teacher?&#8221;
Katherine Moore asked. The other girls
were under the impression that she had not
heard what they were saying.
</p>
<p>Evan jumped up quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never, I should hate it! I mean to study
folk dancing and some day originate new
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
dances that shall be as American as possible.
We talk of the folk dancing of the Irish and
Spanish, and the Austrians and the Dutch
and any number of other nations. When we
speak of American folk dancing it is supposed
we dance like the Indians. I don&#8217;t see why
we can&#8217;t create a national folk dance of our
own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Evan made a cup of her hands and dropped
her chin into it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t laugh; I think an American
folk dance might be like these young beech
trees. I know that sounds absurd. What I
mean is, the dance should show youth and
freshness and grace, beautiful things like a
primeval American forest. Oh, I don&#8217;t suppose
you understand me. I am sure I don&#8217;t
quite understand myself!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since I have been at camp Miss Mason
has allowed me to come here an hour each
morning to practice. May I show you the
dance I have been trying to compose. I
don&#8217;t mind if you laugh at the dance or at
me, I do it so badly. I shall learn some day.
I like to call it &#8216;The Dance of the Young
Beeches&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Without waiting for Kara&#8217;s or Tory&#8217;s
agreement, Evan was up and away. Slowly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
she again circled around the beautiful dancing
ground, her arms and body waving with
gentle, fanciful undulations.
</p>
<p>Now and then she seemed to be swept by
light winds; again a storm pressed upon her
and she bowed and swayed as if resisting with
all her strength. Afterwards, wishing to suggest
that the storm had passed and the sun
was shining and the birds singing, she tiptoed
about, her arms gently undulating, her
face looking upward.
</p>
<p>The dancing was crude and yet would have
been attractive to eyes more accustomed to
trained dancing than Tory&#8217;s or Kara&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>Tory&#8217;s first sensation was one of pure,
artistic pleasure. Then glancing at Kara she
felt a deeper joy. A moment Kara appeared
to have forgotten her own misfortune. She
looked more interested, more entertained than
in many days.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think, Evan, that if your
mother is well she might be persuaded to
come to your camp and teach us dancing?&#8221;
Kara demanded, as if she too could be included
in the lessons. &#8220;I know when we first decided
to have our camp in Beechwood Forest one
of the things we talked of doing was learning
outdoor dancing. We hoped Miss Mason
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
would be able to teach us. She only knows
ordinary dances, and insists she does not even
know the newest of these. She has not gone
into society since the death of the young
officer to whom she was engaged,&#8221; Kara confided.
&#8220;Sometimes I wonder if being Captain
of our Girl Scout Troop has not helped her
almost as much as the rest of us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stopped abruptly.
</p>
<p>Farther off in the woods the three girls
heard a strange sound.
</p>
<p>It was as if some one were calling. Yet the
noise was not the Girl Scout signal.
</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, on the way back to
camp, unexpectedly the three girls beheld
Teresa Peterson hurrying on alone. She looked
surprised, even a little frightened, by their
appearance.
</p>
<p>When Tory inquired where she had been,
as Teresa made no reply, the question was
dropped.
</p>
<p>No one was supposed to leave the camp
without special permission from the Troop
Captain. There was no reason, however, to
suppose that Teresa had not received this
permission.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>OTHER GIRLS</h3>
</div>

<p>The other girls in the camp in Beechwood
Forest were not passing through
so trying an ordeal as Victoria Drew
and Katherine Moore, after Katherine&#8217;s return
to camp.
</p>
<p>Sympathetic they were with Kara&#8217;s misfortune,
yet upon them it did not press so
heavily.
</p>
<p>Frankly two of the girls acknowledged that
the few weeks at camp were the happiest of
their entire lives. These two girls were
Louise Miller and Teresa Peterson. Neither
of them was particularly congenial with their
home surroundings.
</p>
<p>An odd contradiction, Louise Miller was
oftentimes so quiet, so slow and awkward in
her movements that many persons regarded
her as stupid. This was never true among the
friends who knew her intimately, if for no
other reason, than because of Dorothy McClain&#8217;s
attitude. From the time they were
children the two girls had admired and loved
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
each other, notwithstanding the difference in
their natures. Dorothy was one of the happy
persons whose attraction was so apparent
that few natures resisted it. She was handsome
and straightforward and sweet tempered.
One girl in a family of six brothers, she had
learned a freemasonry of living, and had not
the sensitiveness and introspection that
troubles so many young girls. Her mother
was dead, yet she and her father had been
such intimate friends that she had not felt
the keenness of her loss as she must have
under different circumstances.
</p>
<p>Indeed, Louise Miller, whose parents were
living, endured a deeper loneliness.
</p>
<p>There had never been any pretence of anything
else. Her father was a business failure.
This had narrowed and embittered his nature.
He was devoted to his wife but to no one else.
</p>
<p>She had cared for society and beautiful
surroundings and been forced to do without
them. To have Louise, her oldest child,
another disappointment, was difficult to bear.
</p>
<p>If Louise had been pretty, if she had
appeared to be clever, if she had cared for
her home life and been anxious to assist her
mother with the younger children, Mrs.
Miller would have been quick to appreciate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
any one of these characteristics. But Louise
was not handsome, she insisted upon disliking
every character of household work, and her
position at school was not always above the
average. In certain classes she did excel.
Louise herself was the last person who could
have explained why there were days when she
was so absorbed that she seemed more than
ordinarily dull even in the subjects that sometimes
interested her.
</p>
<p>She was never a favorite with her teachers
or with strangers. But for one thing Louise
was always grateful. Her own troop of Girl
Scouts sincerely liked her, for her own sake
as well as Dorothy&#8217;s. Only Dorothy she
believed really understood and cared for her
deeply in spite of her faults and idiosyncrasies.
</p>
<p>With Dorothy alone she felt able to say
and behave exactly as she desired. She could
drop into one of her moods of self-absorption,
or speak as if she were thinking aloud. Not
always were her ideas clear even to herself
until she had slowly evolved them.
</p>
<p>Now these days in the woods Louise felt
freer, less awkward and self-conscious. Mysteriously,
unexpectedly, she was finding herself.
</p>
<p>With the other girls nature study was a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
pastime, or merely a necessity of their outdoor
Scout training. With Louise it was
becoming a passionate delight.
</p>
<p>The note of the first bird singing deep
among the beechwoods found her awake and
guessing the name before slipping noiselessly
outdoors to see if the warbler could be discovered.
</p>
<p>The other girls were amused by the fact
that Louise wandered about all day carrying
a nature book in her hand. She studied the
trees and flowers, even the stones, silent most
of the time while her companions chattered.
If one of them asked a question concerning
the outdoors that she could answer, she would
become eloquent enough. But to Dorothy
McClain alone she confided her deeper spiritual
and mental reactions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is as if I had been asleep all my life
before, Dorothy, dear, and was only beginning
to wake up. Somehow I cannot explain it,
even to myself, I feel so convinced that this
summer in the woods will have a tremendous
influence on my future life. I am going to
find something in these woods that I have been
looking for in a stupid fashion since I was a
little girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are what the winds and sun and waters
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
made us,&#8221; Dorothy quoted, glad to recall at
this moment the lines her father so often
repeated.
</p>
<p>Louise shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I mean something different. We all
are what you have just said. I feel lately
that the outdoors is going to do something
special for me. Actually I mean I am going
to find something here the rest of you may
not find.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Louise laughed. She had a large mouth
with strong, white teeth. &#8220;That speech of
mine would annoy my mother dreadfully.
She says I am always dreaming and never
interested in <i>real</i> things. Nothing ever seemed
real to me until this summer in Beechwood
Forest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Carefully she smoothed the brown army
blanket on her cot bed.
</p>
<p>She and Dorothy McClain were straightening
their tent preparatory for inspection in
the hour after breakfast. Their flag raising
and Scout drill were the first features of the
long summer day.
</p>
<p>The tent was scrupulously neat.
</p>
<p>Dorothy McClain stooped to pick up a
fallen book. She was paying a slightly
puzzled attention to the other girl&#8217;s odd conversation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Would it not be difficult to persuade your
mother to believe, Louise, that you and I are
interested in our camp housekeeping? Miss
Mason said the other day you probably would
earn a merit badge before the summer was
past for cooking over a camp fire. Is this
because you are preparing to spend your
entire life out of doors?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dorothy appeared amused and incredulous.
She was devoted to athletics and a thoroughly
normal and delightful person. Nevertheless,
the two people for whom she cared most,
excepting her father, were her brother Lance
and her friend Louise Miller, both of whom
were unusual.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are an angel, Dorothy, to try to be
sympathetic with me. You can&#8217;t know what
I am talking about, if I don&#8217;t myself. There
is only one other person in the world to whom
I could speak, Miss Frean. When I know
better what I am only dreaming of at present
I shall confide to her and ask her advice.
Isn&#8217;t it fine to think of her nearby in her little
House in the Woods, always ready to give us
help and advice. Tory declares she would
never have dared to insist we have Kara at
camp with us when she is so ill and unhappy
except for Miss Frean&#8217;s nearness.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>Her task accomplished, Louise turned aside
from her cot bed and put her arm about the
other girl&#8217;s shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dorothy, I know I am selfish with you.
I suppose because I am so tongue-tied with
other people I pour forth everything upon
you. I have not forgotten you said you
wanted to speak to me about something this
morning when we were alone. What is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dorothy stooped and glanced in the small
square mirror which hung suspended from
one of the tent poles.
</p>
<p>Her bright chestnut hair was braided and
twisted about her head. Ordinarily her
father objected to this grown up fashion. At
camp Dorothy insisted that two long plaits
were always in one&#8217;s way. Her eyes were a
clear blue with a slight hint of gray, her skin
healthy and freshly colored. A fine, frank
line formed her lips. Altogether she was the
type of American girlhood who represents
many of our highest ideals.
</p>
<p>At the present moment a frown appeared
between her brows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did want to ask your opinion about something,
Louise. Yet nothing is more important
to me than to see how happy you are this
summer and how the life in the forest is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
changing you. What I wanted to ask is your
view concerning the apology the Boy Scouts
have made us for their rudeness. Shall we
or shall we not bury the hatchet and agree
to forgive them? The situation is particularly
uncomfortable for me. I don&#8217;t like to
take any special position in the matter,
because Lance and Don are my brothers.
Lance has confessed he was principally responsible
for their effort to frighten or tease us
soon after our arrival at camp. So far as I
have been able to find out we seem about
evenly divided on the subject. Tory Drew
wishes to forget all about it. She is so grateful
to Don and Lance for rescuing Kara that
she refuses to consider anything else. Edith
Linder agrees with Tory besides Evan Phillips
and several other girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Strangely the persons most opposed to
forgiving the boys and making friends again
are Margaret Hale and Joan Peters.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are to vote on the question to-night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But here comes Teresa. Perhaps she will
tell us how she feels on the subject. I wonder
what is the matter? She looks worried, and
she has been so happy at camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the tent opening Teresa appeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do come on down to the lake and let us
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
sit there a half hour and talk if you have
finished your work?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Teresa&#8217;s olive coloring had deepened in the
weeks in the sunshine and fresh air, her cheeks
were more rose colored, her wide eyes with
their half mature, half childish expression
were slightly plaintive at this instant.
</p>
<p>The shores of the lake, not a great distance
from the camping ground, were a favorite
resting place for the Girl Scout Troop.
</p>
<p>Not only did they rest here and hold long
conversations, of necessity here a good deal
of the camp work took place. Clothes and
dishes were washed, water was had for cleaning.
Farther up on the left-hand side, where a
shore of bright pebbles ran down into the lake,
was the bathing beach for the campers.
The water for drinking was obtained at a
pure spring up the hill of the Three Pines
which rose not far off from the camp.
</p>
<p>At present, as the greater number of the
girls were still busy in their tents, the vicinity
of the lake was agreeably solitary.
</p>
<p>As the three girls sat down Louise Miller
said suddenly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a legend of a lake where every
night at midnight a maiden arises bearing in
her hands a silver bowl. One may make a
wish and cast it into the silver bowl. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
the maiden disappears. On another night,
one can never know exactly when, the maiden
returns and on this night grants your wish.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish she would appear at once,&#8221; Teresa
grumbled. &#8220;I have a wish she might be persuaded
to grant. I want something more
exciting to happen at camp. Oh, I am enjoying
it of course, but of late the days have been
a good deal alike.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it you want, Teresa?&#8221; Louise
Miller demanded a little scornfully. Two
girls could not have been more unlike. Because
Louise was intellectual she could not altogether
refrain from regarding the other girl
with a mixture of pity and amused contempt,
as well as occasional envy.
</p>
<p>Teresa was so pretty, so gentle and confiding
and pleasure loving. When she failed
to live up to the Scout rules, as all of the girls,
being human, did now and then, no one ever
blamed Teresa. Nor did Louise Miller understand
that Teresa represented the type of girl
who oftentimes has a stronger will than any
other, hidden beneath her apparent gentleness.
Teresa was not conscious of possessing a
strong will. In fact, she would have denied
the fact, believing she was telling the exact
truth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>She only knew that in a quiet fashion she
wanted what she wanted very intensely and
that it was almost impossible to give up any
wish. She might try her best, she might even
pretend to herself that she had given up. The
desire was inclined to be only asleep and to
wake again. One must remember this characteristic
in hearing of Teresa Peterson&#8217;s after
career.
</p>
<p>Teresa shrugged her shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not anxious to talk to you, Louise,
only it is so impossible to see Dorothy without
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Teresa flushed prettily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There, I don&#8217;t mean to be rude. One is
now and then without intending it. I suppose
you are such a profoundly intellectual
individual you cannot bear with my frivolous
character.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only want to say to Dorothy that I am
specially anxious to have our camp of Girl
Scouts make friends with the Boy Scouts. I
have a special reason and promised to do my
best with the girls. But of course I know I
have not a great deal of influence, like you
have Dorothy, or Margaret Hale, or Tory
Drew.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Teresa&#8217;s voice and manner became vaguely
plaintive.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then we could have occasional dances, or
supper parties, something to vary the outdoor
monotony. Oh, of course I love the camp
better than being at home. I only thought
we were going to have some other associates
beside just our own Troop. Most of the boys
are our old friends and Don and Lance are your
brothers, Dorothy. I don&#8217;t see any point in
our always avoiding each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see, Teresa, feminine society is not
enough for you. I wonder if it ever will be,&#8221;
Louise remarked with such profound disgust
and annoyance that Dorothy shook her head
reproachfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so cross, Ouida, I am sure Teresa
does not mean any great harm. I like boys,
I am obliged to like them with six brothers of
my own. Besides, I feel as Teresa does that
it is stupid and self righteous of us to continue
to refuse to have anything to do with the
Boy Scouts simply because they once offended
us. Certainly I miss the opportunity to see
Lance and Don now and then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Anxious to be out of the conversation,
Louise Miller picked up a book of nature
studies on the New England country, by
John Burroughs, and began reading.
</p>
<p>Teresa Peterson&#8217;s nature was not a straightforward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
one. Without actual proof Louise
Miller felt this instinctively. Of course there
was no great harm in her. But then all the
more reason why she might make mischief
without intending it.
</p>
<p>A few moments later the three girls moved
back toward camp. Tent inspection was over
and they were going for an all-day hike through
the woods.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>LIGHT AND SHADE</h3>
</div>

<p>Victoria Drew sat on the lowest
step leading into the evergreen cabin.
This was the name she preferred to call
it. Inside Kara lay asleep.
</p>
<p>There was no one else at the camp in
Beechwood Forest at this moment.
</p>
<p>The other girls and the Troop Captain had
departed for a day&#8217;s hike, not to return until
late afternoon.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless Tory and Kara had not been
alone. This never occurred; Edith Linder
had remained to be useful and to relieve Tory.
As a matter of fact, the Troop Captain, Miss
Mason, and half a dozen girls had insisted
that Tory go forth for the long hike. The
day was a perfect midsummer day and each
and every one of them would gladly remain
with Kara.
</p>
<p>Tory had declined. In face of the argument
that it was her duty to give the other Girl
Scouts the opportunity to be useful to Kara,
who was their friend as well as her own, Tory
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
insisted that to-day she was too tired for a
long tramp. In any case she would stay on
at camp. Some other day she would be glad
to change places.
</p>
<p>At present Edith Linder had gone the half
mile or more away to the little House in the
Woods on an errand. She had promised to
help prepare supper before the camping party
could return. Finding herself in need of supplies
she had explained to Tory and slipped
away. Kara would not be apt to awaken soon
and there appeared no immediate need for her.
</p>
<p>In truth Tory was glad to be alone for an
hour.
</p>
<p>In a short time the sun would set.
</p>
<p>Weary Tory believed she wanted an hour
for quiet thinking.
</p>
<p>Earlier in the day Teresa had confessed
that she was feeling a degree of disappointment
in the summer camp.
</p>
<p>Tory Drew was disappointed, but for different
reasons.
</p>
<p>The past winter had been the most difficult
she could remember. After a wandering
existence abroad with her artist father, it had
not been simple to find her place and to make
friends in Westhaven. Yet she had accomplished
both. Her aunt, Miss Victoria Fenton,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
did not regard her with great affection, nevertheless
at least she had agreed that the younger
Victoria had become slightly less trying. And
she and her uncle, Mr. Richard Fenton, at
first not liking each other, had become devoted
comrades.
</p>
<p>Save for his interest and aid the summer
camp, now surrounding her like a quiet
guard, would never have been a possibility.
</p>
<p>Growing a little restless, Tory changed her
position.
</p>
<p>Would it not have been better had she gone
on the errand to Miss Frean and asked Edith
to watch beside Kara. Of late Kara frequently
showed that she was weary of so much of her
society.
</p>
<p>Moreover, without confessing the fact, Tory
appreciated that she was suffering from the
strain. She was tired and nervous oftener
than she was accustomed to feeling.
</p>
<p>A quiet talk with Memory Frean and a walk
to the House in the Woods would have done
her good.
</p>
<p>Her uncle had said that he hoped this summer
would give them an opportunity for a
closer intimacy. He believed that her influence
would be of benefit to Tory. If their
friendship of long ago had ended, he had not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
for that reason ceased to admire Miss Frean.
</p>
<p>At this moment a breeze swept through
Beechwood Forest, setting the leaves shimmering
with a fairylike enchantment.
</p>
<p>An instant Tory was aroused from her
reflections.
</p>
<p>She was alone with no one to disturb her.
Why not slip into her tent and find her sketch
book? She probably would have time for a
sketch before Kara awakened or Edith Linder
returned.
</p>
<p>Unaware of her own action, Tory shook her
head.
</p>
<p>She was too tired to sketch, and worse, felt
no inspiration or desire. Next to her grief
over Kara was her disappointment in regard
to her summer&#8217;s work.
</p>
<p>Miss Mason had agreed that she might try
for a Merit Badge as an artist during their
camp. Surely she had sufficient talent to
have won it. She had looked forward to having
an arm filled with worth-while sketches
of her outdoor summer to show her father
upon his return to Westhaven.
</p>
<p>Now she must face the fact that she would
have not a single drawing she would care to
submit to competent judges, not even a sketch
she would be willing to have her father
criticize.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>Of course she would be glad to have sacrificed
her summer to Kara, if Kara had revealed
a moderate amount of appreciation.
</p>
<p>In truth Kara was not even as fond of her
as she had been in the past before she had
been able to show her devotion. To do one&#8217;s
best and always seem inadequate is not a
condition many persons can face cheerfully.
</p>
<p>Inside, in the room beyond the open door,
the other girl stirred, and Tory glanced in.
</p>
<p>On a cot by a window Kara lay asleep.
</p>
<p>The room had changed since her coming.
Formerly it had been the Girl Scout living
room. Here they had eaten their meals and
held their Scout meetings on the occasional
rainy evenings when their more splendid outdoor
meeting place had been less comfortable.
</p>
<p>This could still be managed if Kara were
well enough or in the mood to take part. But
always her comfort and her wish were first.
</p>
<p>Thrown over her at this moment was a gay
woolen cover made by her own Troop of Girl
Scouts. During the past winter each of them,
who had not known how previously, had
learned to knit as a part of their home training.
The suggestion had come from Teresa
that each girl knit a square of her favorite
color, and thus a rainbow scarf might shed
good fortune upon Kara.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>So far, Tory decided, with a sudden trembling
of her lips, the promise had not been
fulfilled.
</p>
<p>Kara was no happier in body or mind since
her return to the camp.
</p>
<p>Yet the room in which she was lying at
present asleep was altogether charming.
</p>
<p>The sunlight, fading into its last brilliancy,
shone through pale yellow curtains. On the
mantel above the fireplace was a brown bowl
of yellow wild flowers. Perched above, with
wings outspread, was Mr. Richard Fenton&#8217;s
last gift to the evergreen cabin, the stuffed
figure of an American eagle. A splendid
specimen, one instinctively looked up toward
it on entering the room. Over it were the
words, &#8220;The Girl Scouts of the Eagle&#8217;s Wing
in Beechwood Forest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A table drawn up near the couch was filled
with flowers, books, magazines and small
articles. Scarcely a day passed that Kara did
not receive a gift of some kind, not only from
the Girl Scouts and their families, but from
her many friends in Westhaven.
</p>
<p>Yet, apparently, Kara no longer cared for
what in the past would have given her happiness.
At one time she had been glad to feel
that Westhaven did not regard her merely as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
a little waif who had been left upon their
bounty and brought up at the &#8220;Gray House.&#8221;
She was the ward of the entire village. Now
this was of no further concern to her.
</p>
<p>Tiptoeing softly into the room, Tory closed
a window without arousing the sleeper.
</p>
<p>Strange to think that Kara long ago had
slept in this same room and been rescued by a
stranger! What would be her emotions if
she knew that in this house, tumbled down
and uncared for, she had been deserted as a
baby?
</p>
<p>Tory decided that she must remember to
warn Mr. Jeremy Hammond, who had rescued
Kara, never to recall the fact to her mind.
Dr. McClain had agreed that for the present
this would be wisest, as in no possible way
must Kara be excited or depressed.
</p>
<p>True, Mr. Hammond had never been to see
Kara since her accident! He must have
learned of her misfortune. A large box of
roses had arrived at the &#8220;Gray House.&#8221; Yet
neither Mr. or Mrs. Hammond nor Lucy had
come personally to inquire.
</p>
<p>At the thought Tory&#8217;s face flushed with
annoyance. Mr. Hammond had not been
attracted by Kara when he appeared at the
orphan asylum with the idea of adopting the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
little girl he had discovered long ago. Instead
he had chosen Lucy, the little girl whom Kara
had cared for as if she were a small sister.
Lucy, at least, should have paid daily visits to
see if she could be useful. Possibly she had
forgotten Kara amid her new wealth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, <i>she</i> would never forget or be unfaithful,&#8221;
Tory thought with a sudden intensity of
feeling characteristic of her. Some day Kara
must surely find someone or something to
compensate her for her difficult girlhood!
</p>
<p>If only there might be a treasure, some fortunate
inheritance, hidden away in the little
evergreen house, left there by the parents
who seemed to have cared less than nothing
for their baby!
</p>
<p>At her own dreaming Tory smiled. She
then tiptoed out of the room again. The
place had been thoroughly searched for information
and not a line had been discovered
save the slip of paper with Kara&#8217;s name,
&#8220;Katherine Moore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Outside on the veranda Tory did not sit
down at once.
</p>
<p>She could see some one approaching toward
the camp down the long path. Edith Linder
was probably returning. It was, perhaps, as
well. Miss Mason, the Troop Captain, insisted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
that the girls never be at camp or in the woods
alone.
</p>
<p>If Miss Frean knew she would doubtless
come back with Edith. Tory hoped this might
be true. There were so many questions to
discuss. Kara had proposed an interesting
suggestion earlier in the day. Evan Phillips&#8217;
mother might be induced to teach their own
little group of Girl Scouts outdoor dancing.
Where could there be a more perfect opportunity
than here in the heart of Beechwood
Forest in their own &#8220;Choros,&#8221; or dancing-ground?
</p>
<p>The figure approaching was not a girl&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>At some distance off Tory recognized Lance
McClain. He was strolling calmly along in
the most unconcerned fashion, a book open
in his hand. Now and then he glanced down
and read a few lines.
</p>
<p>Not the slightest intimation did his manner
reveal that he ought to regard himself as an
unwelcome visitor in the Girl Scout camp.
</p>
<p>Tory had not seen him since the morning
when he had aided in bringing Kara home.
On that occasion he had been told that the
girls were still undecided whether they wished
to have anything further to do with Lance&#8217;s
group of Boy Scouts during their summer
camping season.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Tory; I hoped I would find you
outdoors,&#8221; he called out amiably when within
a few yards of the evergreen house.
</p>
<p>Tory ran down the steps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make a racket, Lance! What in
the world are you doing here? Kara is asleep
and I am on guard. You know you are not
supposed to come to our camp. I feel as
people used to in the old fairy stories and
legends. Somehow I must try to save you
from having your head chopped off, or some
other fearful end. I do consider you deserve
it, but somehow it would be unpleasant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your gentleness and kindness of heart
overpower me, Oh, Victoria of Beechwood
Forest,&#8221; Lance answered. He bowed in the
graceful fashion that for some unexplainable
reason often aggravated Tory, and Dorothy
and Donald McClain; Lance&#8217;s own sister and
brother.
</p>
<p>Lance was too unlike other boys at times
not to be trying.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down to the shore of the lake with
me, won&#8217;t you Princess Nausicaa?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;See how well I remember the
name some one bestowed upon you when I
was here before. I have another reason for
recalling it. I shall explain in another instant
if you will be so good as to listen.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What a pleasure to find you alone! Of
course I expected it. I can&#8217;t say I should
have cared to enter this particular camp if I
had been forced to face the entire troop of
disapproving maiden Scouts. Still, there is
something I am anxious to have brought to
your attention. Come along, Tory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so far away as the lake, Lance. I&#8217;ll
come to the big beech here near the cabin.
I&#8217;ll know then if Kara wakes and wants me,
yet we will not be near enough to disturb her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Under the deep green shelter Tory looked
more searchingly at her companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say you expected to find me at camp
with most of the other girls away. Did you
see them on their hike or did Dorothy tell
you we were planning an all-day tramp?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have seen no one and heard nothing
from Dorothy. If I have a secret source of
information isn&#8217;t that my affair? In any
case you would not have me betray another?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory sighed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, for goodness sake, Lance, do say what
you intend to say in a straightforward fashion.
I wish you were more like Don. One can
always understand and depend upon Don.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>Then, when she saw Lance flush, Tory
regretted her speech.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am all too accustomed to that remark,
Tory. I assure you that if I have seen any
one from your camp or received any information
concerning you, it is not because I
desired to be disagreeable. I was hoping I
might be allowed to extend you the olive
branch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, I have the olive branch with me.
It is hidden away in my book.&#8221;
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE ODYSSEY</h3>
</div>

<p>Tory took the book into her own
hands. Sitting down on the ground,
she opened the leaves carefully.
</p>
<p>Nothing to suggest an olive branch met her
gaze, not a pressed leaf or a flower which might
have served as a symbol.
</p>
<p>Seated beside her, Lance&#8217;s thin face, with
its tanned skin and humorous brown eyes,
peered eagerly over her shoulder.
</p>
<p>Tory shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Explain yourself again, Lance. What has
this book, the story of the wanderings of the
Greek hero, Odysseus, after the Trojan war,
to do with ending the feud between your troop
of Boy Scouts and our own of girls?&#8221; Tory
patiently inquired. &#8220;I know you have some
idea in mind, but it takes a cleverer person
than I to fathom it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gently Lance removed his book from the
girl&#8217;s clasp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Tory, for a few moments while I
read to you. Then I&#8217;ll tell you what I mean
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
and ask for your help if you are willing to
give it. You look tired and it may rest you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gladly Tory submitted. Clasping her hands
together in her lap, she let her eyes wander
from their first glance at the little log cabin
with its bright covering of evergreens on and
away into the deeper green of Beechwood
Forest, now shadowy with the approach of
evening.
</p>
<p>Lance could be agreeable when he liked.
The winter before, when first she had been
introduced to Dorothy McClain&#8217;s six brothers,
she had liked Lance better than the others.
She even had preferred him to Don, his twin
brother, whom people in Westhaven insisted
was the handsomest member of the family.
</p>
<p>During an illness of Lance&#8217;s she had been
able to save him from being seriously burned.
Afterwards, curiously, they became less friendly.
In any case Tory knew that she at present
preferred Don. Not only was he handsomer
and stronger and more straightforward, he
showed a sincerer liking for her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So there the stout-hearted Odysseus lay
and slept, worn out with all his toil. But
meanwhile Athena went to the Sea-Kings&#8217;
city, up to the palace of their ruler, the wise
Alcinous and into the beautiful chamber
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
where his daughter lay asleep, the young
princess, Nausicaa, fair as the Immortals.
On either side of the threshold two maidens
were sleeping, as lovely as the Graces, and
the glittering doors were shut. But the Goddess
floated through them like a breath of
wind up to the head of the couch, and spoke
to Nausicaa in a dream. She seemed to her
one of her dear companions, the daughter of
Dymas, the sailor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Lance continued reading Tory did not
listen attentively. He had a pleasant, quiet
voice that shed a restful influence upon her
as he had hoped.
</p>
<p>Tory was not especially fond of reading, not
to the extent that her uncle, Mr. Richard
Fenton would have liked. He spent the greater
part of his time in his library at the old
Fenton house in Westhaven.
</p>
<p>Miss Frean in her own little House in the
Woods gently reproached Tory now and then
for her lack of interest in books. Perhaps
neither one of them could understand that
pictures were what she cared for intensely.
The pictures need not of necessity be of the
character that hang upon walls. Tory was
seeing pictures at this moment which were
affording her the deepest pleasure.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>If only she had her neglected sketch book
in her hands!
</p>
<p>Bent over his book Lance&#8217;s head would
have made an interesting sketch even if she
were unable to obtain a satisfactory likeness.
</p>
<p>Then Tory forgot Lance and the outward
objects surrounding her. The words he was
reading aloud were creating a beautiful image
in her mind. She seemed able to see &#8220;The
Princess Nausicaa, fair as the Immortals.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her companion read on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;So the night passed away, and the young
dawn appeared on her glorious throne and
awakened the princess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a bang Lance closed his book.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop dreaming, Tory Drew. You scarcely
know I am present and I want you to be particularly
sensible and attentive to what I
am going to say. I suppose you know I have
been reading the story of the Odyssey, since
you told me Miss Frean had read it to you
early in the summer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory laughed. For all his quietness and
apparent gentleness Lance&#8217;s nature was more
domineering than most persons appreciated.
Their friends believed that Don ruled in the
intimate friendship between the two brothers.
More often than not they were mistaken.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We have been having a great time at our
Scout camp, Tory. Hope you girls have had
as good! I have enjoyed the summer a lot
better than I expected. I know I have
improved in the drilling and a few other things.
Lucky for me that I am fond of a few outdoor
sports; keeps up my end in the Scout proficiency
tests!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Lance, but why don&#8217;t you come
to the point? I know it is hard for you to
have to give your time and energy to so many
things and never be allowed to study the
music you love. But then, of course, your
father knows best. I can understand his not
wishing you to be a musician,&#8221; Tory added
hastily, fearing she might appear to be criticising
the doctor whom she loved and admired.
&#8220;I can appreciate your father saying that
with six sons and a daughter and he only a
small town physician, he never could afford
to let you have the musical education you
would require.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Tory, no use going into that
subject now. I have heard all that a good
many times. What we were talking about was
the Scout organizations, yours and mine. I
think they are specially good for us; for you,
because you are an only girl and kind of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
spoiled by pretty nearly everybody. Good
for me because I am a selfish fellow who likes
to be alone unless I can hang around with
Don. We get the combination of freedom and
discipline we both need.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At first this summer I thought the other
fellows were not going to have much use for
my queer notions. I thought they stood for
me because Don is very nearly the most popular
Scout in camp. I was kind of pleased
when they chose me to come over to camp and
extend the olive branch to you Girl Scouts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The thin, brown face was now eager and
glowing, but Tory remained as completely
mystified.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember the tableaux your troop of
Girl Scouts gave in Westhaven this spring?
They were a great success and I, for one, shall
never forget how you looked as Joan of Arc.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since our Boy Scout Troop has been
trying to get up something as good. This
summer we decided would be our best chance
with all the fellows together and our officers
and several members of our Scout Council
staying at camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Tory replied, beginning to be anxious
to go back to Kara and wishing Lance
would finish what he was endeavoring to say.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>The other Girl Scouts might come back to
camp at any moment. She did not wish to
be discovered seated under a beech tree conversing
with Lance McClain, whose presence
at their camp was neither invited nor desired.
Later she would be able to explain, but for the
moment she would not enjoy the position.
</p>
<p>Lance smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate you are in a hurry, Tory, as
well as the other things you are thinking.
You need not believe I wish to be discovered
here until you have had a chance to make
things clear to Miss Mason and the Girl
Scouts. But I want to put my proposition
to you before you have your outdoor meeting
to-night to decide whether you wish to make
friends once more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Tory was puzzled to understand how
Lance could know so much of their daily
program. His next suggestion drove all
other thoughts from her mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To get to the point: After a lot of reading
and discussion we have concluded to
close our summer holiday with an outdoor
pageant. I suppose one should call it a
pageant. We are not going to do exactly
what other people have been doing all summer.
We don&#8217;t intend to present New England
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
history. After the big pageant at Plymouth
Rock, it would take a good deal of nerve to
try to imitate it. So we have decided to
present the &#8216;Wanderings of Odysseus.&#8217; We
are not sure as to details. Our plan is to have
a series of Greek tableaux that will tell the
story and have some one person read certain
of the lines aloud.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory leaned forward.
</p>
<p>She appeared interested but doubtful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a pretty big idea, Lance. Do you
feel you will be equal to it? Presenting an
American pageant is one thing, but gracious!
who knows what Greek pictures should be
like?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I am sure the girls will be
delighted if there is anything we can do to
be useful. You were awfully kind about
helping us,&#8221; Tory continued, feeling she had
not appeared as enthusiastic as Lance might
have hoped. &#8220;But where is the olive branch
I am to offer the girls to-night when we have
our meeting to decide whether we are willing
to make friends?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance flushed and looked uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The olive branch is what I have been
talking about, Tory. The Boy Scouts want
you girls to take part in our Greek pageant.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
We want you to take the feminine rôles.
Now, don&#8217;t say no, right off, Tory, and don&#8217;t
be so discouraging as you seem to feel. I
confess I am counting on your influence in
more ways than one. The truth is the suggestion
came from me, and I have had a hard
enough time trying to make the other fellows
see the thing as I do. Suppose we don&#8217;t
accomplish anything remarkable, it is fun to
have had a try. And it is worth while trying
to make people see things and think things
that have had to do with other nations at
other times in the world&#8217;s history. I want
you to talk to your uncle, Mr. Fenton, and
to ask his advice before we go much further.
I suppose you know he is a Greek scholar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>During Lance&#8217;s speech Tory&#8217;s expression
had become more sympathetic and convinced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the idea is possible, Lance. In
any case, I am delighted to help all I can by
talking to Uncle Richard and using whatever
influence I have with the girls. Only one
thing, you must not count on my taking part.
I could not give up the time from being with
Kara.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand, Tory; we&#8217;ll see how it works
out. I was thinking of Kara as I came over
here to talk to you. A lot better than a good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
many other people I believe I can understand
Kara&#8217;s present state of mind. You see, I
have been sick myself. Kara will brace up
once she gets hold of herself. Don&#8217;t you take
anything she says or does too seriously.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance and Tory got up and began walking
back toward the evergreen cabin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know if this thing goes through I
believe it may be a help to Kara. She isn&#8217;t
strong enough for a lot of excitement, but it
will give her an outside interest. Right now
she needs to think of something beside herself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I ought to have strength of
character enough not to mention it. But
there are days when the fact that I am never
going to have a chance to be a great musician
gets hold of me, and I know there is nobody
on earth then who is as disagreeable as I can
be. I don&#8217;t see why Kara cannot play some
part in the tableaux. She could be seated in
her chair as if it were a kind of throne,&#8221; Lance
concluded.
</p>
<p>The girl looked at him gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can be a comfort when you wish to
be, Lance, and you are right, you can be
dreadfully disagreeable. Only you are not
very often.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would your telling me how you know
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
what we are doing at our Girl Scout camp
involve some one else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, so I decline to mention names. Now,
don&#8217;t be stupid and think I mean anything
serious. If two people meet they have a right
to speak to each other. Good-by, I must be
off. I think I hear the Girl Scouts returning.
Do the best you can for us.&#8221;

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>CONSULTATIONS AND DECISIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>At the close of their evening&#8217;s discussion
the Girl Scouts had not finally
decided whether to accept or reject
the invitation tendered them by Tory Drew.
</p>
<p>They would be friends again. This opinion
was at last unanimous. But to take part in a
Greek pageant which would require a sacrifice
of time and energy from the routine of their
camp life? This represented a deeper problem.
</p>
<p>There must be a longer period for consultation.
The advice of their Girl Scout Council
must be asked. Upon this, Miss Mason, the
Troop Captain, insisted, before even expressing
her own point of view.
</p>
<p>By the following afternoon she and Tory
and Edith Linder started out for the little
House in the Woods to talk over the idea with
Memory Frean, who represented one of their
chief sources of wisdom.
</p>
<p>The summer afternoon was a perfect one.
Illimitably beautiful pale dappled gray clouds
filled the summer sky, shutting out the fierce
rays of the sun.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>As they hoped, from a little distance off
the three newcomers discovered Miss Frean
busy in her garden.
</p>
<p>Tory saw her first. She made a motion with
her hand to suggest that they approach softly
without being observed.
</p>
<p>The older woman wore no hat, and a simple
outdoor cotton dress of pale gray, with a deep
blue scarf over her shoulders.
</p>
<p>Her hair was more carefully arranged than
usual in the shining, heavy brown braids Tory
so often had admired.
</p>
<p>In truth Memory Frean had begun to take
more interest in her personal appearance since
her meeting with Victoria Drew on the wintry
road. So long she had lived alone in her little
House in the Woods, with her outdoor interests
in the summer time and her books in
winter, that she had grown too careless.
</p>
<p>The meeting with Tory had brought back
old friends and memories. Tory had introduced
her to the Girl Scouts of the Eagle&#8217;s
Wing. Now, as a member of their Council,
Memory felt as if the girls were her adopted
daughters.
</p>
<p>Edith Linder had been in a measure her
adopted daughter. She had lived for the past
winter in the house with Miss Frean.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>Now Edith uttered an exclamation of
pleasure, which at Tory&#8217;s gesture she quickly
subdued.
</p>
<p>Memory Frean was standing in the center
of a plot of grass with her arms outstretched.
Fluttering about her head were a family of
wrens. Two had alighted within the palms
of her hands and were gazing toward her
with serious intentness.
</p>
<p>In a nearby tree stood a new bird house,
which she must recently have placed in position,
as not far off was another bird house
smaller and shabbier. Outside the door of
the new home a feast of bread crumbs had
been spread.
</p>
<p>By and by one of the wrens flying near the
new abode, pecked at a crumb. Something
gave him confidence and courage. Inside the
open door he disappeared. Instantly the
entire family followed.
</p>
<p>The three visitors burst into a cry of admiration.
Memory Frean came toward them,
still with her arms outstretched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been expecting you all day. No
Girl Scout has been near me since Edith came
on a borrowing expedition late yesterday
afternoon. If you had waited any longer I
should have been offended. See, I have put
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
on a clean dress, and the water is boiling for
tea, and the table spread in the Shakespeare
garden.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Frean led the way, with Edith and
Tory clinging to her and Sheila Mason following.
</p>
<p>The herbs in the Shakespeare garden were
in the perfection of bloom. In the fragrance
of the summer air mingled the pungent odors
of thyme and marjoram, sage and rosemary.
</p>
<p>A bunch of the herbs decorated the small
round table.
</p>
<p>Edith Linder disappeared toward the kitchen
for the tea, while the three others sat
down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Edith Linder has been a success as a Girl
Scout this summer, has she not, Sheila? We
did our best to prepare for the honor last
winter. Edith and I realized that Tory
opposed her joining your troop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory flushed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it very kind of you, Memory Frean,
to refer to one&#8217;s past mistakes, especially when
I am your guest?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Memory Frean laid her large but beautiful
hand, a little roughened from outdoor work,
upon Tory Drew&#8217;s sensitive, slender one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I should apologize to you, Tory.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
I only meant to say that I am glad you finally
agreed to allow Edith to enter your Patrol.
I do not believe any of you quite realize what
the honor meant to her. In a brief time she
seems to have changed more than any one
I have ever known. She had not had much
of a chance in the past. Occasionally last
winter, when she was with me, she gave Tory
the right to her prejudice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The large hand had not been raised from
the smaller one.
</p>
<p>Still weary, from what cause she could not
guess, Tory felt as if the strength and vitality
of the older woman were flowing gently into
her.
</p>
<p>Scarcely listening more than was necessary
for politeness, she leaned her head against
her companion&#8217;s shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe one of the most difficult things
in the world to realize is that when people fail
to possess the characteristics we have agreed
they ought to possess, the failure nearly
always comes from lack of opportunity, not
from choice. I don&#8217;t mean to be preaching
truisms, I was only thinking of this in connection
with the Scout organizations. They
bring opportunities to so many who would
have had no chance otherwise. Edith Linder
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
had never had the opportunity or the spur she
needed. Her ambition to be a good Scout
has given her both.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wake up, Tory. Are you being nice to
Edith as you promised me to be? She likes
and admires you, and I am sure would not
mind my speaking of this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are three girls in our summer camp
who have the greatest personal influence over
the others. It is interesting to watch,&#8221; Miss
Mason remarked, smiling at the older woman.
&#8220;Of course, under the circumstances I do not
include Kara. Her illness makes her influence
of a different kind at present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory lifted her head, more interested in
the discussion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have noticed this about Margaret
Hale and Dorothy McClain. I am not so
sure, I think the third girl is Joan Peters,&#8221;
she ejaculated and relapsed into quiet again.
</p>
<p>The two women glanced at Tory and then
at Edith Linder, who was at this instant
coming across the yard with the tea.
</p>
<p>The two girls were an apt illustration of
Memory Frean&#8217;s last expressed opinion.
</p>
<p>Edith had grown tall in the past year. Her
features were large and a little coarse, but
handsome in their own fashion. There was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
about her a look of capacity. If she had
desired she could easily have lifted and carried
the other girl who was nearly her own age.
Edith&#8217;s family had been small farmers for
generations. Tory Drew&#8217;s had been students
and artists and writers. She had no appearance
of physical strength and yet her vitality
was probably as great.
</p>
<p>She looked admiringly at the other girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Edith is splendid. She knows more of
cooking and practical things than any girl
in camp. She was trying to teach me to cook
and we were together a good deal of the time
before Kara&#8217;s accident. Now I see little of
any of the other girls, although I really think
Kara often would prefer anyone&#8217;s society to
mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Edith was by this time engaged in pouring
the tea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I like to behave as if I were more at home
in the House in the Woods than any one of
the other Scouts,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;After all,
I am the only one who has lived here, although
Tory is an older friend and my greatest rival.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Edith spoke as if she meant seriously what
she was saying. Yet she spoke with entire
good nature.
</p>
<p>It had been agreed not to discuss the subject
of the pageant until her return.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>The next half hour the two women and two
girls talked of nothing else.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you should speak to other members
of the Council beside me,&#8221; Miss Frean
argued. &#8220;Mr. Fenton is fairy godfather to
the camp in Beechwood Forest. He is Tory&#8217;s
uncle and I think should be consulted. If
I remember correctly he used to be a Greek
scholar. He is not apt to have forgotten,
and if he thinks well of the idea can be of
great assistance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before dusk Sheila Mason and Edith Linder
started back for camp. They left Tory to have
supper with Miss Frean, who promised to
bring her home later.
</p>
<p>The suggestion had originated with the
Troop Captain.
</p>
<p>Tory protested that Kara would need her
services and be hurt if she failed to appear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I want Miss Frean to talk to you for
a special reason, Tory. I am sure you will
find that the other girls, with my help, are
capable of caring for Kara this one evening
without you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The little edge to Miss Mason&#8217;s speech Tory
had never heard her use before. It left her
flushed and silent. She remained alone in the
Shakespeare garden while Miss Frean walked a
few yards into the woods with her guests.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>In what fashion was she failing as a Girl
Scout, that her Troop Captain felt compelled
to ask some one else to lecture her? Why had
she not told her wherein lay her fault?
</p>
<p>Tory found her eyes filling with tears. She
was glad to be for a few moments alone. Not
often was she given to this particular form of
weakness. She disliked it in other persons,
but of late her nerves had been troublesome.
Were the other Girl Scouts finding her a difficult
member of their camp group?
</p>
<p>By and by the older woman returned. At
first she and Tory said nothing upon any
intimate topic. They continued to stroll
about the garden until dusk.
</p>
<p>Their supper was to be a simple meal of
bread and milk and fruit that would give no
trouble.
</p>
<p>Since she had begun to study and love the
New England country this garden of Memory
Frean&#8217;s had become of intense interest and
affection to the young American girl who had
spent so much of her life in foreign lands.
</p>
<p>Within the yard and upon the border of
the deep woods beyond she had learned the
names of a wide variety of trees, birds and
flowers. She knew the differences between
the white and black and yellow pines, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
spruce and the cedar and the several species
of maple trees, the ashes and the birches.
She had learned that the beech tree is singularly
arrogant and permits few other trees to
grow inside its woods.
</p>
<p>At this season of the year the birds were less
in evidence than earlier in the spring. Now, as
darkness fell, Tory discovered that a greater
number sang their evensong in Memory
Frean&#8217;s garden than near their own camp in
Beechwood Forest. True, Miss Frean made
everything ready for their reception.
</p>
<p>Placed about the yard were half a dozen
wide open bowls filled with fresh water.
</p>
<p>The garden boasted a hedge of currant
and raspberry bushes at present loaded with
ripe fruit. There were no scarecrows about
and no one ever made an effort to drive the
birds away, so they were accustomed to plucking
the unforbidden fruit of this garden.
</p>
<p>This evening Tory assisted at the daily
scattering of crumbs. This took place when
possible at exactly the same hour.
</p>
<p>Afterwards she and Memory Frean hid
behind a shelter, where concealed they could
watch the flight of the birds into the garden.
</p>
<p>Some floated in from outside, others came
down from their nests in Miss Frean&#8217;s own
trees to partake of her hospitality.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>This evening, appearing with the more regular
visitors, was a golden-winged warbler,
splendid with his conspicuous yellow wing
bars. Close behind him came a pair of tanagers.
</p>
<p>The female Tory did not recognize until
Memory Frean explained that she was a dull
green olive in color, unlike her brilliant,
scarlet-coated husband.
</p>
<p>In fact, Tory and Miss Frean did not go
indoors until, from somewhere deep in the
woods, a whippoorwill began his evening call.
</p>
<p>In the meantime Tory had happily forgotten
there was any subject to be discussed
between herself and her friend that might not
be an altogether happy one.
</p>
<p>She did think of it, however, while she
was eating her supper on a small table in
Memory Frean&#8217;s living-room, drawn up before
a small fire.
</p>
<p>The night was not particularly cool, yet
the fire was not uncomfortable, and had been
lighted at Tory&#8217;s request.
</p>
<p>The older woman had finished eating and
sat holding an open magazine in her hands.
</p>
<p>Tory&#8217;s eyes studied the room, with which
she now had grown familiar, with the same
curiosity and pleasure. The room was so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
simple and odd. The hundreds of old books
in their worn coverings, only a few new ones
among them, lined the walls. By the window,
the couch was covered with an old New
England quilt, of great value, if Tory had
realized the fact. The furniture was so inexpensive,
the little pine table before her, the
larger one with Memory Frean&#8217;s lamp and
books and a bowl of flowers, the chairs and
long bench.
</p>
<p>What a contrast to her own austere and
handsome home in Westhaven, now the
property of her uncle and aunt, Mr. Richard
Fenton and Miss Victoria Fenton. If Memory
Frean and her uncle had not ceased to care
for each other perhaps there would have been
no little House in the Woods.
</p>
<p>Tory finished her supper and her reflections.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Memory Frean, what is it Miss Mason
wished you to talk about to me? How am I
failing as a Girl Scout?&#8221;
</p>
<p>When no one else was present she used the
older woman&#8217;s first name, loving its dignity
and soft inflections.
</p>
<p>Memory Frean put down her magazine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not failing, Tory, not in one sense.
You are trying to accomplish too much. This
is, of course, another form of failure. Take
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
your dishes in to the kitchen and then sit here
on the stool by me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Five minutes after she continued:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Tory, it is with Kara you are
making a mistake. You are doing yourself
and Kara both injustice. Miss Mason tells
me she has talked to you and that the other
Girl Scouts have protested, yet you remain
selfish about Kara.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl made no answer. If she did not
like the accusation, she did not at present
deny it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From the first you have been sentimental
over your friendship with Katherine Moore.
Kara first made a strong appeal to you when
you were lonely and antagonistic toward
your new life in a small New England town.
This drew her closer to you than had you
grown up together in ordinary girl fashion.
Besides, you are romantic, Tory. You respond
to the people who call forth that side of you.
The mystery surrounding poor Kara has fascinated
you. The fact that she knew nothing
of her parents has made you feel that you
could be more to her than had she enjoyed
the family affection other girls receive. I
believe in your heart of hearts you have
planned some day to be Kara&#8217;s fairy godmother
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
and make up to her for what she has
failed to receive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if I have, is it so wicked of me?&#8221;
Tory demanded.
</p>
<p>Memory Frean smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid so, Tory dear, although many
wise persons may not agree with me. I don&#8217;t
think it often is allowed us to play special
Providence to other people. Since Kara&#8217;s
accident more than ever have you been trying
to accomplish this for her. You have been
wearing yourself out and Kara feels this and
cannot enjoy it. In their own ways the other
Girl Scouts resent your belief that Kara must
always prefer you to be with her and to care
for her. She was their friend and they knew
and loved her before she came into your life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Together you agreed to bring Kara to
camp and to see if you could make things
easier for her. The other girls want their
chance too, Tory. Don&#8217;t you realize, dear,
that you are growing tired out from too much
responsibility. You can&#8217;t help Kara if you
are tired and nervous and, though you may
not confess it to yourself, a little resentful of
your own disappointment in the summer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember you told me what a lot of
outdoor sketching you intended to do. Your
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
father had given you permission to work at
your painting and drawing in the summer
time, provided you gave your time and energy
to your school in the winter. You have not
shown me a new drawing since Kara&#8217;s accident.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, don&#8217;t you suppose the other girls
miss having you with them on some of their
excursions? Martha Greaves, the English
Girl Guide, must have felt many times that
you have been neglecting her. She is a
stranger and in a way has the right to depend
upon you. Am I reproaching you for too
much all at once, Tory?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl arose up from her low stool and
stood with her hands clasped and a frown on
her forehead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have said a good deal, Memory Frean.
If you don&#8217;t mind, suppose we start back to
camp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory made no other reply. After a little she
and Memory Frean were walking along the
path that led in the direction of Beechwood
Forest.
</p>
<p>Tory was no more fond of criticism than
most persons, and less accustomed to it.
Her mother had died when she was a small
girl, and her father had been her devoted
friend and admirer, rarely her judge. To her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
aunt Miss Victoria Fenton&#8217;s efforts at discipline
Tory had yielded little. Her uncle,
Mr. Richard Fenton, made no attempt at
discipline, but had been sympathetic toward
her after the birth of a rare understanding
between them.
</p>
<p>To-night Tory was angry with the person
whom, next to Kara, she had believed her
dearest friend in Westhaven.
</p>
<p>Mistakes she may have made in her devotion
to Kara. But Memory Frean, Sheila
Mason, her Troop Captain, and her own
Girl Scouts might have appreciated the situation.
</p>
<p>She had been with Kara when the accident
took place that might result in the tragedy
of her life. Dr. McClain and the two surgeons
with whom he consulted could only say there
was a possibility of a future recovery. But
before anything could be hoped for Kara
must reach a happier state of mind and body.
</p>
<p>Never had there been any pretence that
she and Kara were not more intimate and
devoted than any other two girls in their
Troop, save perhaps Dorothy McClain and
Louise Miller.
</p>
<p>Then what was one to do but give Kara all
that one possessed?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>However, if Kara were wearying of this
and really preferred the other girls, Tory
appreciated that she was probably being a
nuisance. She would not speak of it to
Memory Frean or Miss Mason, but in the
future Kara should not be so bored by her
society.
</p>
<p>Walking on together through the woods,
once Memory Frean attempted to put her
arm inside Tory&#8217;s. Quietly Tory drew away.
</p>
<p>The dusk was deepening. After a time
footsteps behind them could be heard. It was
as if some one were following them.
</p>
<p>A screech owl called and startled her; Tory
had a sudden attack of nerves; running ahead
a few yards, she stumbled. The footsteps
were coming nearer.
</p>
<p>Memory Frean put an arm about her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand still, Tory. Let us wait here and
see who is approaching.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>OUT OF THE PAST</h3>
</div>

<p>The stranger was a middle-aged man
with iron-gray hair. He was carrying
his hat in his hand and enjoying the
beauty and fragrance of the late evening in
the woods.
</p>
<p>As Tory rushed toward him, Miss Frean
stepped back into a deeper shadow.
</p>
<p>The newcomer was Tory&#8217;s uncle, Mr.
Richard Fenton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How stupid of me to have been frightened!&#8221;
she exclaimed. &#8220;I have been taking
supper with Miss Frean and she is walking
back to camp with me. You were coming to
camp to see us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Fenton agreed, walking forward to
speak to Memory Frean. Except for an occasional
meeting upon the streets of Westhaven,
and one or two brief conversations with
regard to the Girl Scout camp in Beechwood
Forest, they had not seen each other in many
years.
</p>
<p>To-night in the depth of the woods, with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
Tory walking between them, they talked as
if neither of them recalled any past intimacy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been a little worried about you,
Tory,&#8221; Mr. Fenton said finally. &#8220;You have
not been in town to see me in a number of
days. I thought it was agreed that we were
to see each other once a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have missed you dreadfully, but I
have been so busy. I thought if you became
very lonely you would come and find me,&#8221;
she announced, with the familiarity of a
delightful intimacy.
</p>
<p>By and by when Miss Frean and Mr. Fenton
continued talking, the barrier between them
increasing, Tory scarcely listened, thinking
their conversation not particularly entertaining.
</p>
<p>They were merely discussing the weather
and the scenery.
</p>
<p>In another quarter of an hour the lights of
the camp showed nearby. Darkness had not
completely descended. Outdoors one could
still see one&#8217;s way.
</p>
<p>The chief lights appeared inside the evergreen
cabin, while in front of the door stood
a large automobile.
</p>
<p>Fearing that Kara had grown unexpectedly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
worse, Tory darted away from her companions
and into the cabin.
</p>
<p>The car she saw was not Dr. McClain&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>Entering the room, notwithstanding the
lateness of the hour, she found it filled with
people.
</p>
<p>Kara sat in the center in her wheeled chair.
She looked pale but excited and interested.
</p>
<p>Three visitors were standing near her. They
were Mr. and Mrs. Jeremy Hammond and
the little girl, Lucy Martin, whom they had
adopted some months ago.
</p>
<p>In the years at the old Gray House on the
hill in Westhaven Lucy had been Kara&#8217;s
special charge.
</p>
<p>If Tory had been fascinated by the little
girl&#8217;s extraordinary beauty in the past, she
was more startled to-night. The room was
lighted only by candles and a single large
lamp under a yellow shade.
</p>
<p>Lucy wore a pale yellow dress of some filmy,
soft material and a large hat circled with a
wreath of flowers.
</p>
<p>She had removed her hat and held it as
one would a large basket. Her dark hair made
a stiff aureole about her delicately cut face
with its pointed chin, large brilliantly black
eyes and full red lips.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>Then Tory was both startled and repelled
by the younger girl&#8217;s expression.
</p>
<p>She was staring at Kara with no suggestion
of sympathy or affection; instead, she looked
shocked and frightened and even disdainful.
</p>
<p>Kara was extending her hands toward the
little girl with more animation and pleasure
than Tory had seen her reveal since her accident.
</p>
<p>And actually, with a faint shudder, Lucy
was drawing away.
</p>
<p>An impulse to seize the little girl by the
shoulders and forcibly thrust her out of the
evergreen cabin assailed Tory.
</p>
<p>She moved forward. In the meantime Mr.
and Mrs. Hammond, becoming aware of
Lucy&#8217;s behavior, were endeavoring to conceal
her rudeness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kara, Lucy has been insisting each day
that we bring her to see you. We did not
know at first that you had gone from the
Gray House. Afterwards Mr. Hammond was
away for a short time and we were waiting for
him,&#8221; Mrs. Hammond remarked, speaking
hurriedly but with extreme graciousness.
</p>
<p>She was a pretty, exquisitely dressed woman
of about thirty years with light brown hair
and eyes. She appeared an agreeable society
woman but without any especial force of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
character. Evidently if she cared a great
deal for Lucy, the little girl in time would
have small difficulty in having her own way.
</p>
<p>This would not be equally true with Mr.
Hammond.
</p>
<p>At present he was divided by annoyance
with his adopted daughter and a kind of
puzzled curiosity.
</p>
<p>He was staring about the gay room filled
with girls and then at the figure in the wheeled
chair.
</p>
<p>Kara appeared to be interested in no one
save Lucy.
</p>
<p>Now as the child shrank away from her,
her thin hands dropped in her lap, her face
looked whiter and her gray eyes with the
heavy dark lashes grew sadder and more
wistful.
</p>
<p>A little murmur, not actually voiced and
yet capable of being heard, ran through the
room.
</p>
<p>This time Lucy must have understood the
antagonism among the group of Girl Scouts
that her manner had created.
</p>
<p>At one time, and only a few months before,
Kara had been everything to her, sister and
nurse and friend. A few months of wealth
and she seemed completely spoiled.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have many friends, Kara, but if
there is anything Mr. Hammond and I could
possibly do for you, you have only to let us
know,&#8221; Mrs. Hammond suggested at this
moment, not very tactfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very kind, but there is nothing
to be done,&#8221; Kara returned coldly.
</p>
<p>Apparently she had lost all interest in her
guests, now that Lucy had so utterly forgotten
the old days at the Gray House on
the hill. She always had been an odd little
creature, passionate, self willed and self
seeking. Still, Kara had never doubted her
affection.
</p>
<p>Not yet eight o&#8217;clock and Kara not expected
to retire until nine, nevertheless Tory looked
about the room in search of Miss Mason.
Kara was being wearied. Better the room
full of people be asked to go outdoors. They
could talk on in the deepening dusk.
</p>
<p>At the open door Sheila Mason was talking
to Miss Frean and Mr. Richard Fenton. At
the moment she was not thinking of Kara and
the three other visitors.
</p>
<p>Trying to make up her mind to speak to
Mr. and Mrs. Hammond herself, Tory saw
that Mr. Hammond suddenly appeared restless
and at the same time absorbed in thought.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Miss Kara, I wonder if you would
like me to tell you something? I am not perfectly
sure and perhaps have not the right to
speak. Yet after all I am pretty well convinced
that I am not making a mistake and
you cannot fail to be interested. You need
things to interest you these days, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond spoke abruptly. Tory considered
that his manner was kinder and he
showed more interest in Kara than upon the
day when he had come to the old Gray House
to seek the little girl he had rescued years
before. Then he had been fascinated by
Lucy and Kara had been disregarded.
</p>
<p>Kara looked up now with slightly more
animation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do need something to interest me
these days, Mr. Hammond. I am afraid you
will find me pretty difficult. Only a few weeks
ago I cared so intensely for our summer camp
in Beechwood Forest and every one of our Girl
Scout occupations that nothing else appeared
of the slightest importance. Now when
everyone is so good to me I don&#8217;t seem interested
in anything. There are so many Scout
subjects I could study when I have so much
time and I don&#8217;t care to take the trouble.
I really am stronger perhaps than I pretend
to be.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>Kara&#8217;s tone was so unhappy and listless
that Mr. Hammond&#8217;s agreeable face clouded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your state of mind is due to the fact that
you have not recovered from the shock of
your fall. You won&#8217;t feel like that always,
sure not to, a girl with the courage and good
sense you have always revealed. Still, what
I am going to tell you is obliged to stir you
up. I don&#8217;t believe you will object to the
other Girl Scouts hearing what I tell you.
You are such devoted friends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since I entered this pretty room I
have experienced an odd sensation connected
with it. Somehow it seemed associated with
you. This may not appear remarkable, the
room is now your sanctuary and I am sure
everything in it is for your service. But that
is not what I have in mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was haunted by an almost forgotten
impression. As I drove up to the cabin this
afternoon, I felt that I had been in this
vicinity before. Here something unusual had
taken place which had left a strong impression
upon me. I felt this more keenly when I
entered this room, although I never beheld
any other room so gay and pretty and filled
with so many girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The room was not always like this, Kara.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
You Girl Scouts must have seen the room a
little as I beheld it a number of years ago,
when you chose this spot for your summer
camping grounds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I not once confide to you, Kara, that
I discovered a tiny little girl in a deserted
farmhouse when I was a young man, riding
along a lane in this neighborhood? It looked
more like an abandoned farm in those days to
a man who knew extraordinarily little about
farms. Perhaps the little house was never
anything more than a cabin in the woods,
with farmlands in the neighborhood. If so,
they have vanished. Do you recall, Kara, the
little girl I discovered and who she afterwards
turned out to be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>At last Tory Drew felt her senses returning,
and at the same time an impulse to action.
During Mr. Hammond&#8217;s rambling story she
had remained quiet, listening and yet all the
time knowing its conclusion.
</p>
<p>Previously Dr. McClain had impressed
upon her the fact that Kara had been found
in the little house in which she was living at
present. If Mr. Hammond had once called
the cabin a farmhouse, Dr. McClain had
always been certain of its identity.
</p>
<p>It was the doctor&#8217;s opinion that Kara must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
not for the present be excited or disturbed by
any reference to this fact.
</p>
<p>At last Tory was aware that she should
have spoken sooner, that any protest from
her at present would come too late.
</p>
<p>With all her listlessness vanished Kara was
leaning forward, her eyes on the speaker,
while the other Girl Scouts appeared almost
equally interested.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>RETROSPECTION</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Now that I look back, the room seems
to have been extraordinarily clean
under the circumstances, although
it was bare and poor,&#8221; Mr. Hammond continued.
&#8220;There was just a bed and some
chairs and a table. You were lying on the
bed, Kara, and if you had objected to being
left alone, you were perfectly agreeable and
sweet tempered after I made your acquaintance.
I remember you were extremely amiable
during our ride together into Westhaven.
You gave me an impression which I still
carry with me that you would meet most
situations with grace and good sense.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond began wandering about the
room. He appeared embarrassed by the
intensity of Kara&#8217;s attitude and the conviction
that possibly he had not chosen a wise
time or place for his revelation.
</p>
<p>In fact, he had no intention of speaking of
the matter at all. Surprise at finding himself
a visitor to the girl in the same spot where he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
had discovered her as a baby had influenced
his discretion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything else you could tell me,
Mr. Hammond? You need not regret having
spoken before the other girls. They are my
friends and really know as much of my history
as I know, there is so little information I
have ever received.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am afraid not, Kara, I am sorry.
Now and then I have considered that possibly
we did not make a sufficiently thorough investigation.
Yet I do not honestly believe this.
At the time I searched the room thoroughly.
I waited, thinking that in all probability
some one would come back for you. Then,
when I gave up this idea and took you with
me to Westhaven, we did not fail in making
another effort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. McClain, I recall, insisted upon this
and we came out here together. Moreover,
we left a letter stating that if any one desired
to find you, information could be had of Dr.
McClain in Westhaven.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There does not seem to be any doubt, no
one ever did return and no one ever wished
to find me. I have always thought, almost
hoped that my mother and father were dead,&#8221;
Kara answered.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>No one else had spoken during the grave
and dramatic conversation between Kara and
Mr. Hammond. In fact, Kara herself had
said little. Now her words affected the room
filled with her friends with a sense of tragedy.
</p>
<p>Tory Drew moved near the other girl,
standing beside her in a defensive attitude, as
if disaster must first meet her before it could
again touch the friend so dear to her.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hammond took Lucy&#8217;s hand in her
own, attempting to draw the little girl toward
the open door. Some day she hoped that
Lucy might altogether forget the Gray House
and think of herself as her own and Mr.
Hammond&#8217;s child.
</p>
<p>At last Sheila Mason had ceased her talk
with Mr. Fenton and Miss Frean. She turned
toward the center of the room, looking as if
she wished to ask Mr. and Mrs. Hammond to
say farewell. Then the interest in Kara&#8217;s
face and in Mr. Hammond&#8217;s words forbade
the interruption.
</p>
<p>Memory Frean had come into the room and
Mr. Richard Fenton stood immediately behind
her. He was watching Tory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid I have said too much or too
little and perhaps tired or worried you, Kara.
If you like, suppose we have a long, quiet talk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
some day alone. I&#8217;ll come again to see you
and we can go out into the woods together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Conscious of the atmosphere and of his
own imprudence, Mr. Hammond picked up
his hat and stick which he had placed upon
a table.
</p>
<p>Again his own interest in the situation
became stronger than other impressions.
</p>
<p>Walking toward Kara&#8217;s chair, he pushed
the chair a few feet nearer the wall.
</p>
<p>Without explaining his purpose he moved
aside a rug which lay on the floor and struck
the boards with his cane.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has this floor ever been taken up and a
new one laid down?&#8221; he inquired, apparently
of Victoria Drew, who chanced to be standing
nearer than any one else.
</p>
<p>Tory shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. The floor was in extremely
good condition when we decided to
make this cabin the center of our camp in
Beech wood Forest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The bed stood just here,&#8221; Mr. Hammond
indicated with his walking stick the exact
spot where Kara&#8217;s chair had been the moment
before. &#8220;I have always felt we should have
had this floor removed. Kara, if you will
give me permission, when the summer camping
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
days have passed, I should like to undertake
it. There isn&#8217;t one chance in a thousand
we should come across anything, but it would
be worth while to try, would it not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kara&#8217;s expression made no other answer
necessary.
</p>
<p>A few moments after the Hammonds had
said farewell and were gone.
</p>
<p>An instant it appeared as if Lucy wished to
break away and speak to Kara. The other
girl never glanced toward her, or seemed conscious
of her presence after her first display
of affection, so apparently Lucy lost the
desire or the courage.
</p>
<p>Immediately the Girl Scouts departed for
their sleeping tents accompanied by their
Troop Captain.
</p>
<p>Miss Mason would return to say good-night
to Kara and see that she was comfortable for
the night. In the meantime there was the
final evening ceremony with her Girl Scouts.
</p>
<p>In the big room at present were only Tory,
Miss Frean and Mr. Fenton, save for the girl
in the wheeled chair.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fenton approached Kara.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust so many visitors and so much
excitement will not be harmful to you,&#8221; he
said in the dignified fashion that always
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
charmed Kara and his own niece. Mr. Fenton
never addressed them as if they were merely
young girls and of no special importance.
</p>
<p>Always his manner was courtly and agreeable.
</p>
<p>Toward Kara he extended a box of candy
which he had been carrying under his arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know candy is to a large extent a forbidden
fruit at camp. But as you are a kind
of uncrowned queen these days, Kara, I
thought you might be permitted to offer a
sweet now and then to your ladies in waiting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>During this conversation Tory had crossed
over to Miss Frean, persuading her to be
seated on a low bench and sitting down beside
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was deeply offended with you, Memory,
an hour ago when you held a &#8216;mirror up to
nature,&#8217; my nature. I detest being lectured.
Just the same, I promise to try not to bore
Kara too much with my society and to give the
other girls more opportunity. But dear me,
I did think I was doing the right thing! Often
I have wanted dreadfully to go off on our
Scouting expeditions and have remained at
camp because I thought Kara needed me
and did not wish the other girls to be sacrificed.
It does require an extraordinary number
of virtues to be a good Scout.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>Memory Frean shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I would put the case in
just that fashion, Tory. To be a good Scout
demands first of all common sense. You have
the artistic temperament, Tory, and common
sense is perhaps more difficult for you. Glad
you are willing to be friends again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Memory Frean and Mr. Richard Fenton
walked back together to the House in the
Woods. They had not been alone with each
other in more than twenty years.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A PORTRAIT</h3>
</div>

<p>Several days later Tory Drew, accompanied
by two other of her Troop of
Girl Scouts, went forth to spend the
morning sketching, not far from their camp.
</p>
<p>Her companions were Edith Linder and
Martha Greaves, the English Girl Guide, who
was her guest.
</p>
<p>Personally Tory felt considerable embarrassment
concerning her own neglect of the
young English girl who had been left dependent
in a measure upon her interest and friendliness.
She had not intended any rudeness or
indifference. Her greater interest and affection
for Katherine Moore had dominated all
other ideas and emotions.
</p>
<p>Even before Miss Frean&#8217;s lecture Tory had
suffered an occasional moment of self-reproach.
However, only within the past twenty-four
hours had she talked over the situation frankly
and openly with Martha and offered an
apology.
</p>
<p>It was delightful to have discovered her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
to be altogether sensible and agreeable.
Apparently the young English Girl Guide had
understood and accepted the circumstances.
She not only failed to express any show of
resentment at Tory&#8217;s unintentional disregard
of her, she appeared not to feel any resentment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It has all been a wonderful experience for
me, the opportunity this summer to meet and
know so many American Girl Scouts,&#8221; she
explained. &#8220;Nor has it been possible to feel
either lonely or neglected. The other girls
have been so friendly and interested. They
have talked to me of your devotion to Kara
and told me something of Kara&#8217;s difficult life.
I would not have you give up an hour when
she needs you to look after me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory was thinking of this and of other
characteristics of the English girl, as she sat
idly holding her sketch book open in her lap,
a drawing pencil in her hand.
</p>
<p>Martha and Edith had gone over into one
of the fields to look for mushrooms. As
Edith had spent the greater part of her life
on a small farm, she possessed a good deal
of practical outdoor knowledge which the
other Girl Scouts were endeavoring to acquire
through books and teachers.
</p>
<p>Particularly was the English Girl Guide
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
interested in learning all that was possible in
one brief summer concerning the American
woods and fields. Now and then they
appeared oddly unlike her own green and
fragrant country with its miles of cultivated
gardens and carefully trimmed hedges.
</p>
<p>Martha and Edith were especially friendly.
Tory was possessed of sufficient knowledge of
the world to appreciate this fact as indicating
an unusual sweetness and poise upon the
part of their English visitor.
</p>
<p>Obviously Edith Linder came of simple
people. Her father and mother had been
poor farmers and were now working in a
factory in Westhaven. Edith made no pretense
of anything else and had not received
a great deal of education. She had learned
much from her winter with Miss Frean, and
was learning through her summer with her
Troop of Girl Scouts. Nevertheless, there
were ways in which she revealed the difference
in her past circumstances from the lives of
most of the Girl Scouts with whom she was
associated at present.
</p>
<p>To Martha, Edith&#8217;s lack of social training
must have been especially conspicuous. Martha
had been reared in a careful fashion. Her
family had been wealthy before the war and
owners of a large estate.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>Nevertheless the English Girl Guide accepted
Edith&#8217;s efforts toward self-improvement
and her evident desire to make friends
with perfect tact and good breeding.
</p>
<p>Tory knew that social distinctions were
more seriously regarded in England than the
United States. She concluded if ever the
moment were propitious to inquire of Martha
if the Girl Guides represented an effort
toward real Democracy in the sense the
American Girl Scouts trusted that they represented
the same purpose.
</p>
<p>At length Tory took up her pencil and
began drawing.
</p>
<p>She was seated in an open place in the
woods not far from their dancing ground
within the circle of giant beech trees.
</p>
<p>Later in the day Evan Phillips&#8217; mother was
to give the Girl Scouts of the Eagle&#8217;s Wing
their first lesson in outdoor dancing.
</p>
<p>The thought of this in prospect interrupted
Tory&#8217;s effort. With an impatient gesture she
picked up the paper upon which she was working
and tearing it into bits flung the pieces
to the winds.
</p>
<p>Her father insisted that she draw from still
life and she had been using a distant tree as
her model.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>Is there anything in the world more difficult
to represent with its dignity, grace and
beneficence than a tree?
</p>
<p>At this instant Tory certainly was convinced
there was not.
</p>
<p>Half unconsciously her pencil began indicating
the figure of a girl in various attitudes.
</p>
<p>For years, whenever left to her own devices,
Tory had amused herself in this fashion.
However crude her drawings of human figures,
since she was a tiny girl they had in them a
suggestion of life and action.
</p>
<p>A noise, apparently coming from behind a
clump of bushes not far off, distracted the
artist&#8217;s attention.
</p>
<p>Tory raised her eyes.
</p>
<p>Beyond the bushes she thought she beheld
some one move.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Martha, Edith!&#8221; she called out.
</p>
<p>At first there was no reply.
</p>
<p>The second call brought a response.
</p>
<p>From farther away Martha and Edith
halloed in Girl Scout fashion.
</p>
<p>Again Tory returned to her work, having
now acquired the impression that she was no
longer alone.
</p>
<p>Once more she looked suddenly around.
</p>
<p>A figure behind the clump of shrubs undoubtedly
stirred.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>Rising, Tory walked in that direction.
</p>
<p>She had not moved more than a few feet
when the intruder, aware of discovery, came
toward her.
</p>
<p>A small figure Tory beheld dressed in a
pale green linen frock, crumpled and torn.
The large leghorn hat had a band of green
velvet ribbon encircling it. In one hand she
bore a small yellow leather suit case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Lucy, what in the world does this
mean? Are you by yourself? Do Mr. or
Mrs. Hammond know where you are?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you may tell them,&#8221; the little girl
answered calmly. &#8220;I am on my way to Kara.
I am going to take her back to the Gray
House or somewhere else, where we can be
alone. I hated Kara sitting still in a chair
and never moving and all of you keeping me
from her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you do care for Kara?&#8221; Tory demanded,
putting her arms about the picturesque
little figure.
</p>
<p>Coldly but politely Lucy drew away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Care? What do you mean? Do you
mean do I love Kara? Why, I don&#8217;t really
like anyone else very well except Kara and
perhaps Billy and now Mr. and Mrs. Hammond.
Mrs. Hammond says I must be more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
devoted to her than any one else, but I&#8217;m
not truly, now that I know Kara is ill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have run away, haven&#8217;t you, Lucy?
I am sure I don&#8217;t know how you ever got this
far without some one stealing you. You are
the most delightful looking child I ever
beheld. Come and sit down for awhile and
rest and eat some sandwiches. I know you
ran away before breakfast and must be
hungry and tired. Afterwards I&#8217;ll take you
to Kara.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A creative impulse had seized hold of Tory.
</p>
<p>More than anything she could imagine at
the moment she longed to make a sketch of
Lucy, of the little figure in the pale green
gown against the deeper background of green,
the big hat hanging behind her shoulders.
The child&#8217;s cheeks were a vivid rose, her dark
hair still in the stiff aureole that was unlike
other children&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>But it was not the color that Tory wished
to represent. That would have to come later.
She must try to catch the grace of the small
figure, sitting serenely on the ground a few
feet from her munching sandwiches.
</p>
<p>Tory would have preferred that her portrait
model be engaged in some other occupation.
But this made no special difference.
By and by Lucy stopped eating and Tory,
fascinated, went on with her drawing.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>DISAGREEMENTS</h3>
</div>

<p>The decision to take part with the
Boy Scouts in the presentation of the
Greek pageant representing the adventures
of Odysseus was largely brought about
through Mr. Richard Fenton&#8217;s interest.
</p>
<p>He it was who finally persuaded the Troop
Captain, Sheila Mason, to give her consent.
Of chief importance was her point of view,
since she must be responsible for her own Girl
Scouts.
</p>
<p>For many years Mr. Fenton had been an
enthusiastic Greek scholar. To him it appeared
more than ordinarily worth while to
stimulate among the Boy Scouts and the
Girl Scouts an interest in the historic legends
of the past. In his estimation the history
of Greece was of greater importance than any
other nation. In the history of Greece one
finds the model of the first known Democratic
government in the world and according to
many historians the best.
</p>
<p>The outdoor life of the American Scouts,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
planned to develop them mentally and physically,
to make better citizens and wiser men
and women, had its counterpart in the lives
of the early Greeks, centered about their
Olympian games.
</p>
<p>A series of tableaux, accompanied by a
recitation of the story of one of the two great
Homeric poems, would not alone broaden the
outlook of the young people who took part.
Mr. Fenton had a shrewd idea that it would
awaken among the older people in Westhaven
a wider vision of beauty. Like most
small towns, Westhaven was too self-centered.
Mr. Fenton did not wish the little New
England village to share in the opprobrium of
&#8220;Main Street.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Why was it not a portion of the work of
the Scouts to bring fresh ideals of beauty and
romance into their own environments? Mr.
Richard Fenton considered this an important
part of their service.
</p>
<p>To-day, seated with the fourteen Girl Scouts
in a circle about her, Sheila Mason was wondering
if she had not been more idealistic than
practical.
</p>
<p>The girls were in their own council chamber
in Beech wood Forest. No one else was
within sight or hearing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>The story of the &#8220;Odyssey&#8221; lay open in
Sheila Mason&#8217;s lap.
</p>
<p>Katherine Moore, in her wheeled chair,
held another copy. Bending over her, reading
from the same pages, were Margaret
Hale and Louise Miller.
</p>
<p>A few feet away Tory Drew and Dorothy
McClain were writing on large sheets of
paper the instructions that were offered them
from time to time.
</p>
<p>Teresa Peterson, slipping her handkerchief
to her eyes, was wiping away an uncomfortable
moisture. Her cheeks were deeply flushed
and her lips tremulous.
</p>
<p>Lucy Martin sat contentedly on a cushion
at Kara&#8217;s feet.
</p>
<p>She had not been permitted to bear away
the other girl as she had planned. However,
she was allowed to stay on with the Girl
Scouts in their camp for a visit which made
her equally content.
</p>
<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Hammond she had
explained that she could not leave for two
reasons. Kara needed her and Tory was
making a picture of her. Either reason she
considered sufficient. Apparently Mr. and
Mrs. Hammond had agreed for the present.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe, although the boys have left the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
final choice with us, that it will be best to
follow their selection of characters,&#8221; Margaret
Hale remarked.
</p>
<p>The Troop Captain looked up from her
book, first toward Teresa and then Margaret.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not see what else is possible under
the circumstances. We are to make two or
three changes, but they are not important
ones. I am sorry Teresa is disappointed.
She insists that Lance originally suggested to
her she could represent Penelope, so I presume
she has built upon the idea. Yet it
does seem more appropriate for Joan Peters
to play the part of the famous lady with the
web, the wife of Odysseus. There is no question,
Teresa, of your not acting as well, but
this is scarcely a question of acting, but of
appearing to the best advantage in the series
of tableaux. And Joan does look more like
one&#8217;s conception of Penelope than you. Except
for Lance McClain&#8217;s suggestion to you, and
he should not have expressed an opinion
without consulting the others, the choice has
always been between Dorothy McClain and
Joan. The majority finally decided in favor
of Joan because Donald McClain is to appear
as Odysseus and Don and Dorothy are
brother and sister. Perhaps there would be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
less illusion in having them represent a
husband and wife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it is because Joan is taller and
her features more regular and she is prettier,
that she was chosen to play Penelope,&#8221;
Teresa murmured in an injured tone and
with such a gentle suggestion of melancholy,
that Joan Peters appeared extremely uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see it that way, Teresa, and I am
perfectly willing to give up in your favor if
the others will agree. Of course it is ridiculous
to talk of any question of beauty having been
considered. You know you are absurdly
pretty, Teresa, and are merely trying to make
some one say so,&#8221; Joan remarked, half serious
and half amused.
</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, she was not enthusiastic
over being chosen for one of the principal
parts in the Greek tableaux.
</p>
<p>She was not particularly popular with the
Boy Scouts. The boys liked half a dozen of
the other girls better, although Tory Drew,
Dorothy McClain and Teresa were the chief
favorites.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Teresa, don&#8217;t be tiresome. If
we were all to object as you do to the casting
of the characters we will never get anywhere
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
and spend the entire day in argument. Everybody
knows I think it the greatest mistake
in the world not to have had Dorothy in the
leading rôle. Still, I am saying very little
and apologize to Joan for what I have said,&#8221;
Louise Miller protested. &#8220;So let us get on
with what we are trying to accomplish.
Remember, we are to meet the boys and Mr.
Fenton this afternoon and choose the place
for our poetic drama.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Frequently Louise Miller was too impatient
with Teresa&#8217;s small frailties, her love of
pleasure and admiration. This was hardly
fair because of the difference in their temperaments
making any sympathy between them
almost impossible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well there is one person whom we all
agree to be the ideal choice,&#8221; Dorothy
McClain remarked, hoping to turn the conversation
into more agreeable channels.
</p>
<p>She had been sitting on the ground weaving
a chaplet of beech leaves. Rising up now
she placed it like a crown on Kara&#8217;s brow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Behold Athena, the wise Goddess with the
clear gray eyes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A little silence descended upon the group
of girls.
</p>
<p>Kara flushed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is the kindest and most ridiculous thing
in the world to have <i>me</i> take part when I
cannot stir from this chair. I don&#8217;t want to
seem unappreciative. I&#8217;m not really, you
know, but do please explain to the Boy Scouts
that they must realize it is out of the question,&#8221;
Kara argued.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear, we are not going to bring up
that question again. Lance and Don and
Jack Hardin told you that their entire Troop
of Scouts wished you to play the &#8216;Goddess of
Wisdom.&#8217; The tableaux are to be arranged
so you need not appear but once. Then you
are to be seated upon a throne as Pallas
Athena should be. You know how we all
feel on the subject. Surely you do not wish
to disappoint everyone,&#8221; Tory protested.
</p>
<p>She was wondering if the other girls had
observed what she had. In these days of discussion
of the Greek tableaux Kara had
appeared brighter and more like her former
self. Now and then even a glimpse of the
old humor showed in the depth of her gray
eyes or about the corners of her of late too
serious lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tory has expressed what we all feel,
Kara,&#8221; Miss Mason added. &#8220;Now, Tory,
please read aloud the list of the characters so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
far as they have been decided upon. I am
delighted to know that the father of the Boy
Scouts has agreed to be with us on the evening
of the tableaux and will read selections from
the Odyssey as the pictures are presented.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory glanced toward the paper in her lap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Donald McClain will be Odysseus; Lance
McClain, his son, Telemachus; Joan Peters,
Penelope; Victoria Drew, the Princess Nausicaa;
Mr. Richard Fenton, Eumaeus, the
aged servant of the Greek hero. The other
Girl Scouts will be the ladies in waiting to
Penelope and the Boy Scouts Penelope&#8217;s
suitors.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had forgotten to write down that Margaret
Hale will be Arete and Jack Hardin the
good King Alcinous, my respected parents.
I am glad they assisted the wanderer to end
his adventures and return to his faithful
Penelope.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as well that we decided to start our
tableaux with the arrival of the hero on the
island of the Sea Kings! I fear it would have
taxed even our talents to have shown the
enchanted spots where Odysseus was held
enslaved by Calypso with the beautiful hair,
who sang sweetly as she wove at her loom
with the golden shuttle, or Circe, the sorceress,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
who mixed the drink in a golden cup that
turned men into swine. Representing these
Goddesses would have taxed our powers.
Except for Kara we are only mortals.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory rose up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;May I start with Kara to our dancing
grounds? It may take me some time and
Mrs. Phillips is to arrive in less than an hour
for our first dance rehearsal. I have an idea,
or perhaps a hope, that our Greek dance
which Evan is to lead, will be one of the most
beautiful, beautiful things that has ever been
seen in Westhaven.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory reached Kara&#8217;s chair, but at the same
time Dorothy McClain pushed her gently
away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Margaret and I are going to take turns in
pushing Kara&#8217;s chair to our dancing grounds.
We have already made an engagement with
her to that effect. Please remember we are
both stronger persons than you, and Kara
will arrive far more speedily and safely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory appreciated that Dorothy was jesting,
nevertheless, she bit her lips and frowned.
</p>
<p>Kara&#8217;s hand reached around and took hold
of hers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come along with us, won&#8217;t you,
Tory? I know I am selfish, but I do hate being
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
separated from you. If there is time before
Mrs. Phillips arrives why not attempt another
sketch of Lucy? We thought the first sketch
you made of her wonderful, even if you were
not pleased.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the last few days Tory had quietly been
following Memory Frean&#8217;s advice and allowing
the other Girl Scouts to share in the care
of Kara. As a consequence they did seem to
feel more pleasure in being together. But
then for more than one reason Kara was in
a better state of mind.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE CHOICE</h3>
</div>

<p>At four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon Mr.
Fenton sent a large motor car to the
Girl Scout camp to bear Kara, Miss
Mason, Lucy Martin and any other girls who
chose to ride to the place under discussion as
the site to be chosen for the Greek pageant.
</p>
<p>The spot lay midway between the two
camps.
</p>
<p>Earlier in the afternoon Miss Frean had
started off with the girls who preferred the
hike.
</p>
<p>Walking steadily without pausing for rest,
before the others they arrived at the proposed
place.
</p>
<p>When the signal was given to halt, Tory
Drew dropped down on the ground and in the
fashion supposed to be best for meditation
sat looking about her.
</p>
<p>Several of the other girls followed her
example, while Miss Frean remained standing
with three or four companions. They preferred
to command a wider view of their surroundings.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>They had reached the source of the stream
of water which ended in the small lake before
the camp in Beechwood Forest.
</p>
<p>Here the water was fairly deep but the
stream of no great width. On one side was a
small clearing with a grove of trees not far
away. Where the Girl Scouts stood at present
the open space was larger. A dozen yards
away a country road connected with the state
road that ran through the village of Westhaven.
</p>
<p>Beyond were a rim of blue hills.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not be surprised if we conclude
this is the proper location,&#8221; Miss Frean said
reflectively. &#8220;There is the disadvantage of
being so far from Westhaven. We shall have
to transport the scenery and costumes out
here and make arrangements for the audience
to be seated. Yet the place itself is rarely
lovely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory looked at her beseechingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The place is ideal. Please don&#8217;t say a
word against it. Uncle Richard insists that
the early Greeks possessed a greater love of
the beautiful than we possess. Yet surely
this spot would have pleased them!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our tableaux can be shown on the other
side of the water. The audience can be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
seated on this side. The distance will add to
the illusion. The Palace of Odysseus with the
courtyard in front where most of the scenes
will take place, can be constructed in front
of the grove of trees. Odysseus can land on
what is supposed to be the island of the
Sea-Kings from a Greek galley rowed up the
stream. And I shall appear with my maidens
who come down to the banks to wash the
imperial clothes of my royal family. Until
the moment to appear before the audience the
players can be concealed beyond the trees.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Closing her eyes and clasping her hands
ecstatically together, Tory exclaimed:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you not see the entire scene, the
beauty and glamour, what Uncle Richard calls
the Greek spirit that we are to portray?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan Peters laughed and shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Tory dear, I am afraid not. We
cannot all see it, although I must only speak
for myself. Can&#8217;t you appreciate that we
are not all possessed of the artistic temperament
and gifted with the power of seeing
visions? I am a humdrum person who has to
be shown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Joan moved away to join another group.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tory, yours is a fortunate gift, I am not
pretending to deny it. There are times when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
I envy you. Still, dear, some of us before we
can behold the completed masterpiece, are
obliged to consider how we can get a sufficient
number of chairs out here to permit the
audience to be seated comfortably,&#8221; Memory
Frean interposed.
</p>
<p>The girl looked at her half challengingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not so unpractical as you may think.
Uncle Richard and I drove out here a few
days ago and discussed the very problem of
how to seat our audience. He promised to
have any number of chairs sent out at his
expense. We can guess the number required
by the tickets we shall sell. I have an idea
our audience will be very large. After paying
for our costumes and scenery there will still
be a good deal of money to be divided between
the Boy Scout Troop and our own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A noteworthy conclusion, Tory. I am
glad you have made the necessary decisions
and arrangements without waiting for the
other arrivals. A confusion of tongues just
adds to a confusion of ideas,&#8221; Lance McClain
remarked, jumping from his bicycle and
unexpectedly joining the small group.
</p>
<p>Apparently he had ridden on ahead of his
Scout Troop.
</p>
<p>He turned now and greeted Miss Frean.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>Then he came over toward Tory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to be teased, Lance. Of
course I have not made any decision and
nothing positive can be decided until the vote
is taken. I have only been entertaining myself
by dreaming that this is to be the chosen site.
I can see a mental picture that is very wonderful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance shook his head and laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not wishing to be disagreeable, Tory.
Of course this is the ideal spot. It takes you
and me to recognize the fact.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For some reason neither of them understood,
Victoria Drew and Lance McClain usually
argued unimportant issues and agreed upon
the important ones.
</p>
<p>From a little distance beyond, the rest of
the Boy Scout Troop could now be seen
approaching.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Don will be here in a little while,
Tory. Don&#8217;t you and Dorothy worry. I
rode over because the camp doctor thought I
wasn&#8217;t in very good shape. I am not in high
favor at camp at present, so I thought I&#8217;d
do what I was told on this occasion,&#8221; Lance
remarked.
</p>
<p>Only three girls were sufficiently near at
this instant to overhear his speech, Tory,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
Dorothy McClain and Louise Miller. The
other girls and Miss Frean had moved over
to meet the advancing Troop.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about, Lance?
What have you done of late to break the camp
discipline? If you don&#8217;t care for your own
sake, I think you might consider how much
Don and I care for your Scout record. It was
enough for you to have originated the ridiculous
excursion that resulted in the trouble
between your Troop and our own that has
lasted until now. Please, please don&#8217;t get
into any more mischief.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In Dorothy&#8217;s tone there was something
maternal. Lance alone of all her brothers
called forth this spirit in her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sister of mine, you take me too seriously.
I have only wandered off from camp now and
then for a stroll in the woods. I am obliged
to meditate. I have not broken any of the
commandments. It is my misfortune to be
unlike other people. You have told me this a
good many times. So perhaps I am frequently
misunderstood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance&#8217;s tone was so indifferent and teasing
that Dorothy was seriously annoyed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind if Louise and Tory do hear
what I have been wanting a chance to say to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
you, Lance. You had no right to tell Teresa
Peterson that she would be chosen to play
the part of Penelope in our Greek tableaux.
She has been dreadfully disappointed and it
has made things hard for all of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Teresa Peterson to play Penelope! Who
says I made any such suggestion, Dorothy?
Teresa looks more like a pretty doll than the
model of Greek faithfulness and propriety.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dorothy looked puzzled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Teresa told me herself, Lance. She told
me she had met you two or three times by
accident and you had talked to each other for
a little while. She seemed to feel she ought
to speak of it to me and to Miss Mason.
Teresa is a dear, but she isn&#8217;t as clever as some
of the other girls and I don&#8217;t think you would
ever care to be very intimate friends. She
never could understand you as Tory and
Louise do. You did tell Teresa she was to
be chosen for Penelope, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance whistled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so, if she insists upon it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wish you would stick to one story
or the other, Lance,&#8221; Dorothy protested,
moving away with Tory Drew and leaving her
brother and Louise Miller together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose there are not many things I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
would not forgive you, but I never should
forgive your not being truthful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance and Louise remained silent a few
moments after the others had departed.
</p>
<p>Reproachfully Louise studied the thin,
eager face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lance, I can guess it is in your code to
protect a girl by telling a half truth. I suppose
Teresa somehow got the impression she
was to be chosen for Penelope without your
having said so. She is a vain little thing.
But what I want to say is, please never hurt
Dorothy in order to protect anyone else.
Perhaps she is only your sister, but she hates
deceit more than anything in the world, and
you know how devoted she is to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance frowned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Louise, I&#8217;m not in the habit of
telling fibs, so don&#8217;t preach. I am not going
to have Teresa suffer any more criticism from
the rest of you girls. I have met her a few
times and we have talked. She seemed to
think perhaps it was a mistake as long as our
two camps were not friendly, so I am glad
she has spoken of the fact to Dorothy and
Miss Mason. I wasn&#8217;t going to say anything
first.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not worry over Dorothy and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
me, Ouida. We have our scraps now and
then, but there isn&#8217;t another girl I think holds
a candle to her at present, not even you or
Tory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, we ought to be special friends.
We are both &#8216;different,&#8217; and no one ever really
likes being. Dorothy says you have got some
queer idea in your head that you would like
to be a naturalist. That is almost as good as
my wishing to be a musician, when we both
have our own livings to earn, the sooner the
better for ourselves and families. We aren&#8217;t
all Tory Drews in this world!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Louise&#8217;s earnest pale gray eyes with their
dark lashes were staring intently at her
companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with the first part of your speech,
Lance, but I really don&#8217;t understand what
you mean about Tory,&#8221; she returned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you? Well, nothing important.
Only Tory is one of the people who has talent
and charm and things are going to be fairly
easy for her compared to you and me. When
the time comes for her to study art she will
have her chance. Most people are fond of her.
At present in our family old Don and father
will do pretty much anything she asks. So
I thought maybe you and I might be kind of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
special friends, Ouida. I may probably get
into a scrape some day and not know the best
way out and want your help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can always count on me, Lance, if
for no other reason than because you are
Dorothy&#8217;s favorite brother,&#8221; Louise answered
simply.
</p>
<p>Observing that Miss Mason&#8217;s car had
arrived and several others, Lance and Louise
moved toward the newcomers.
</p>
<p>Three members of the Boy Scout Council
and three other members of the girls had
driven out with Mr. Fenton. It was rare in
the history of the Scout movement that the
girls and boys should take part in the same
entertainment and the subject was being
seriously considered.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE GREEK SPIRIT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What is the Greek spirit, Mr. Fenton?&#8221;
During one of the rehearsals for
the presentation of Odysseus, Lance
McClain made this inquiry.
</p>
<p>No one else among the group of boys and
girls surrounding Mr. Fenton at the moment
would have asked the question. Yet, overhearing
Lance, a number of them stood waiting
for the answer.
</p>
<p>The weeks of outdoor work and study had
awakened new ideas and interests.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fenton did not reply immediately;
instead, he appeared to be considering the
question deeply.
</p>
<p>Frequently he had talked of the Greek
spirit. Therefore, what did he actually mean?
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you put that query to me,
Lance,&#8221; he returned finally. &#8220;Half a dozen
times since we began our rehearsals I have
spoken of the &#8216;Greek spirit.&#8217; I have emphasized
the wish that we reveal it in the presentation
of our tableaux. One ought not to talk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
glibly and be unable to offer a simple definition.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At least I can tell you what the &#8216;Greek
spirit&#8217; means to me and why I want us to
give expression to it in our pageant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Try not to be bored if I discuss the subject
seriously for a few moments. You know
I have been a student, not a speaker, all my
life, and there are times when we all wish for
the gift of tongues.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Observing that Mr. Fenton was addressing
not Lance alone who had asked the question,
but the crowd of young people nearby,
Memory Frean and Sheila Mason, Captain
Curtis and several others came and stood on
the edge of the crowd.
</p>
<p>This afternoon they were together on the
side of the stream of water where the tableaux
would be presented.
</p>
<p>In nearly every detail Tory had been correct
in her original conception. The pageant
would be presented in the clear green space
with the grove of shadowy trees as background.
</p>
<p>Across the water the audience were to be
seated in a natural outdoor auditorium. On
a slight elevation of land near the stream the
Father of the Scouts, who had promised to
appear for the evening&#8217;s entertainment, would
read aloud portions of the Odyssey.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>This afternoon, however, the Scouts were
busy building and arranging details of the
outdoor scenery.
</p>
<p>It must be as simple as possible to serve
their purpose.
</p>
<p>Observing the crowd gathering about Mr.
Richard Fenton, the builders also stopped their
toil to join the others.
</p>
<p>A rare experience had come to Mr. Fenton
late in life, and although she never realized
the fact, Tory Drew was chiefly responsible.
</p>
<p>Almost as a recluse Mr. Fenton had spent
the years of his middle age. He was under the
impression that he was not sympathetic with
most people and that they did not care for
him. With a sufficient fortune for his needs,
he had not found it necessary to engage in
an occupation for the sake of making money.
Therefore he had devoted most of his time
to study and thought.
</p>
<p>The result had not brought him a deep
satisfaction. In his young manhood he had
not planned this kind of existence.
</p>
<p>He had contemplated being a public man,
a statesman should he reveal the necessary
ability. In those days he had been young and
meant to make Memory Frean proud of him.
They had separated and he had sought consolation
among his books.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>Then into his own and his sister&#8217;s well regulated
lives Tory had entered the winter before.
She was not Tory to them then, but Victoria
Drew, as Miss Victoria Fenton still insisted
upon calling her niece.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Fenton the young girl had made an
unconscious appeal. Lonely and feeling herself
out of place in a new and strange environment,
she appeared like a gay little tropical
bird or flower transferred to a harsher environment.
When he and Tory became friends the
coldness of the old maid and old bachelor
establishment changed to a pleasanter warmth.
</p>
<p>Introduced to her girl friends, Mr. Fenton
had become a member of their Scout Council.
But not until this summer had he developed
into their chief mentor, and fairy godfather.
</p>
<p>Now to his surprise, added to his other
unsought honors, he found himself the director
of the Greek pageant, one of the performers as
well, and far more popular with his fellow-players
than he yet appreciated.
</p>
<p>Daily they were coming to him with their
problems and their ambitions. As yet their
confidences related only to the approaching
performance.
</p>
<p>Lance&#8217;s question was more general than
any other that had been propounded. While
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
Mr. Fenton was replying he looked at Lance
with more interest than he had felt in the
boy before.
</p>
<p>If no one else understood what he was
endeavoring to make plain, he believed that
Tory and Lance would catch the import of
his words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Among the nations the Greeks are rarely
fortunate,&#8221; Mr. Fenton began. &#8220;They left us
such inheritances that we have remembered
their great days; with other nations we are
too apt to recall the years of their decay,
their mistakes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps one reason for this is that the
Greeks were our forefathers, a branch of the
Aryan-speaking peoples who in the faint twilight
of early history, a nomadic, wandering
people, moved southward, and combined with
the inhabitants of Crete. This gives us the
story of the Odyssey, one of the two great
Greek poems, but more filled with legend than
the story of the Iliad, which is the siege of
Troy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Fenton paused.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not tiring you too much? Still I
must go on. We must try as far as we can
to understand what we have undertaken to
present to others. And I have not yet told
you what I mean by the Greek spirit.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It revealed itself even as far back as these
two poems. The Greeks were then possessed
of two great passions, the love of adventure
and the love of beauty. Those two possessions
I want to be equally the heritage of the
American Girl and Boy Scouts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Later, in what is known as the Age of
Pericles, the Greeks entered into their third
ardor, Democracy, the love of freedom. So
what I call the Greek spirit is the love and
pursuit of these three things: Beauty, Adventure,
Freedom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I might talk longer and you would understand
me less well. Understand, there may
be danger in these three desires. One must
not seek beauty, adventure and freedom at
the expense of other people, but in order to
share it with others as the Greeks have done.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I am through with my lecture, will
some one give me a hammer? I&#8217;ll try to assist
Don in building a footstool for one of Penelope&#8217;s
maids. I&#8217;m afraid I am no better carpenter
than I am lecturer. Do you understand
what I have been trying to explain,
Lance? We may talk the question over
together some other time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I do understand what it means in
regard to the Scouts.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>A moment he stood dreaming when the
others went back to work. Beauty, adventure,
freedom, the Scouts were finding in the
outdoors during the weeks of their summer
camp.
</p>
<p>At present in front of the grove of trees
Mrs. Phillips was starting a rehearsal of the
Greek dance that was to form a part of the
coming pageant.
</p>
<p>Fascinated, Lance stood watching.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A CLASSIC REVIVAL</h3>
</div>

<p>Only now and then does nature allow
us a perfect thing.
</p>
<p>The day of the presentation of the
Greek poem of the Odyssey by the Girl and
Boy Scouts was a perfect day.
</p>
<p>It occurred during the last week in August.
Here at the fringe of the deep woods the afternoon
was like early September; there was
more color, more radiance than one associates
with any other month of the year.
</p>
<p>Beyond the woods the wheat fields were
golden, the final growth of the summer gardens
a riot of purple and rose and blue.
The corn fields having ripened, bent their
green maturity to the breezes, the silk of the
corn tassels made valiant banners. In the
forests the beech trees showed bronze leaves
amid the midsummer foliage, the sumach and
the woodbine were flaunting the scarlet signals
of autumn.
</p>
<p>Along the road leading from Westhaven to
the site in the woods where the Greek pageant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
would take place, from an early hour in the
afternoon motor cars moved back and forth.
</p>
<p>The first cars transported the players and
their costumes and such odds and ends of
scenery as had to be attended to at the last.
</p>
<p>The same cars returned for the families and
friends of the actors. Every automobile and
carriage the town could spare for the occasion
had been commandeered.
</p>
<p>The interest the town of Westhaven and
several neighboring villages displayed in the
Greek pageant was beyond the realms of
possibility in the original conception of the
Girl and Boy Scouts.
</p>
<p>But the summer was closing. In a short
time a good many of the summer residents
would be returning to their city homes. The
thought of a final entertainment, a final
memory of the summer days became inspiring.
</p>
<p>Moreover, a Greek pageant was unusual
presented by groups of American girls and
boys. Probably they would make a failure
of so ambitious an effort, yet it would be
worth while to see.
</p>
<p>The first arrivals among the audience found
several hundred chairs placed in more or less
orderly array upon one side of a stream that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
ran straight as a ribbon along this part of the
countryside.
</p>
<p>Upon an elevation a small platform had
been constructed with a table and a chair so
banked with golden rod and Michaelmas
daisies and green boughs that the wooden
outlines were concealed.
</p>
<p>On the further side of the water was an
ingenious structure, half palace and half tent.
</p>
<p>The walls were of a heavy white canvas, the
roof had been made of narrow lattice and this
covered with green branches.
</p>
<p>In front was the court yard of the palace.
The furnishings were severely simple, a long
bench and a table, a few straight chairs,
little more than stools, and painted white to
suggest marble.
</p>
<p>No other paraphernalia of the approaching
performance was visible.
</p>
<p>Now and then a figure appeared from the
background of trees, never one of the players,
only some assistant bent upon an errand.
</p>
<p>Not upon the shore-line supposed to represent
ancient Greece, but immediately facing
the audience waved a giant American flag.
On either side were the Scout flags, one bearing
the imprint of an eagle&#8217;s wing, the insignia
of the Girl Scouts, the other an elm tree, the
flag of the boys.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>At four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon the pageant
began.
</p>
<p>Before that hour not only were the seats
filled but a number of people were standing.
</p>
<p>A guest of honor of the occasion was one
of the distinguished men who originated the
Scout movement for boys in the United States.
Another guest of honor was a member of the
National Girl Council, who had come up from
the headquarters in New York for no other
reason than to be present at the pageant.
</p>
<p>With simple Scout ceremonies the entertainment
opened.
</p>
<p>A few moments after the applause had
subsided, a beautiful resonant voice read aloud
the first lines describing the Odyssey:
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Sing us the song of the hero, steadfast, skilful and strong,</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Sing us the song of the Wanderer, sing us the wonderful song.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>A moment later slowly rowing down the
stream appeared a solitary figure, Odysseus,
seated upon a raft to which were fixed sails
and a rudder.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>Before reaching the place along the shore
where the boat, built by Odysseus on the island
of Calypso, was to land, a storm was supposed
to beset the hero. The audience beholds him
struggle with the storm and then reach a safe
harbor.
</p>
<p>On the shore he piles up branches and lies
down upon a bed of leaves.
</p>
<p>A short time passes and Odysseus sleeps.
</p>
<p>This opening scene in the tableaux Donald
McClain insisted was the most difficult in
the entire program. During the rehearsals
he had been possessed by the fear that he
would not be able to produce the illusion,
so that his audience would not take him
seriously. Therefore, the tableaux would
begin and end in disaster.
</p>
<p>Don need not have troubled. Very handsome
and heroic he appeared, his dark hair
grayed to represent the age of the Greek hero
who had wandered so many weary years after
the siege of Troy.
</p>
<p>While Odysseus slumbers the Princess Nausicaa
and her maidens come down toward the
river. Unaware of the sleeper, they begin
washing their clothes in the river and afterwards
spread them out to dry in the sun.
</p>
<p>Victoria Drew, as the Princess Nausicaa,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
wore a gown of bright blue with a Greek
design in silver braid. Her bright red-gold
hair was bound in a silver fillet. Her maids
were Margaret Hale, Edith Linder, Martha
Greaves and Julia Murray. Their costumes
were white and crimson, yellow and green.
</p>
<p>In making a careful study of the costumes
worn by the early Greeks, Miss Frean and the
Troop Captain had been surprised to find that
white did not play so important a part in
their dress as they had supposed. Together
with their love for the beauty of line and
form the Greeks possessed an equal love for
color.
</p>
<p>Nausicaa and her maidens begin a game of
ball on the sands. The princess misses the
ball and as it rolls into the water she gives a
cry that awakes Odysseus.
</p>
<p>He comes forward and asks Nausicaa&#8217;s
aid.
</p>
<p>Together they move toward the palace of
the Sea-kings, when the first tableau ends.
</p>
<p>The second scene shows Odysseus seated
inside the tent narrating his adventures to
the good King Alcinous and his wife, Queen
Arete.
</p>
<p>Again the voice of the interpreter recited
further lines from the Greek poem:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 ; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Hither, come hither and hearken awhile, Odysseus, far-famed king!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>No sailor ever has passed this way but has paused to hear us sing.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Our song is sweeter than honey, and he that can hear it knows</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>We know what happens in all the world, and the secret things of life.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>A thrill of appreciation and sympathy
stirred the larger portion of the audience at
the outset of the next tableau.
</p>
<p>Strangers, slightly puzzled to guess the
cause, found that a few hurried words made
the situation clearer.
</p>
<p>Odysseus has sailed from Crete and comes
at last to his own land.
</p>
<p>No change of scenery was possible. The
hearers learned from the recitation that he
had reached the island of Ithaca. Here his
ship was moored in a haven between two
steep headlands near a shadowy cave, where
the water-fairies come to look after their bees
and weave their sea-blue garments on the
hanging looms.
</p>
<p>Odysseus, knowing not that he has reached
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
his home at last, walks up the steep incline
from the shore. Here he meets the Goddess of
wisdom, Pallas Athena.
</p>
<p>Contrary to her own judgment Katherine
Moore had agreed finally to represent Athena;
in spite of the difficulties to be surmounted
not to have accepted would have been too
ungracious.
</p>
<p>From beyond in the grove of trees the
Goddess advances. She is seated in a chariot
drawn by four children. The children wore
costumes of white, short skirts to their knees
and sandals on their feet.
</p>
<p>The Goddess herself was clad in white with
a wreath of green leaves about her hair. Had
the audience been closer she would have
appeared a pale and fragile Goddess with wide
gray eyes set in a delicate, bravely smiling
face. For the old-time Kara had been doing
her best to return these days in order to cast
no gloom upon the pleasure of her friends.
</p>
<p>Better for Kara perhaps that the general
effect of the tableau was what was desired
and not a too apparent view of details!
</p>
<p>This, however, was not true concerning the
little group of children who drew the chariot.
</p>
<p>So startling was Lucy Martin&#8217;s beauty that
not only the Girl Scouts and their older
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
friends discussed it among themselves, the
Boy Scouts, not so apt to notice a little girl&#8217;s
appearance, also spoke of it to one another
privately.
</p>
<p>Fortunately Lucy, in spite of her wilfulness,
was not self-conscious.
</p>
<p>To-day evidently she was thinking not of
herself but of Katherine Moore and Billy,
her former friends from the Gray House on
the Hill.
</p>
<p>A blond Cupid grown slightly older and
thinner, Billy Duncan appeared, with his
blond hair and large childish blue eyes and his
somewhat expressionless face.
</p>
<p>Either the performance of the Greek tableaux
or the presence of the little girl who had
so dominated him during the years they had
spent together at the Gray House made Billy
dazed and speechless.
</p>
<p>There was no need, however, that he should
use any intelligence save to do what Lucy
commanded.
</p>
<p>Her dark eyes sparkled with a brilliant
excitement, her rose cheeks glowed. The stiff
aureole of her dark hair made a striking contrast
to the whiteness of her childish costume.
</p>
<p>The other two children were acquaintances
of Lucy&#8217;s from the Gray House and equally
ready to do her bidding.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>So, whatever the others may have believed,
Lucy Martin was convinced that she had
taken complete charge of Kara&#8217;s tableau.
</p>
<p>Watching the little girl, Kara in a measure
forgot what she felt to be her own unfitness
for her distinguished rôle.
</p>
<p>Athena touches Odysseus with her magic
wand and he changes into an old man, not
wishing to be recognized on his return to his
own palace. Athena&#8217;s chariot is then drawn
back into the grove of trees and Odysseus, now
disguised as a beggar, once more sets out for
his home. The Goddess has presented him
with a worn coat which he places over his
former costume.
</p>
<p>The tableaux did not consume any length
of time, scarcely longer than it requires in the
telling, nevertheless the entire drama of
Odysseus could not be unfurled in a single
afternoon&#8217;s pageant.
</p>
<p>The meeting of Odysseus with the faithful
steward, Eumaeus, played by Mr. Fenton, was
presented without the details one finds in
the story.
</p>
<p>Immediately after the son of Odysseus,
Telemachus, makes his appearance.
</p>
<p>Neither Lance McClain nor Donald had
ever acted until to-day.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>They had both been fearful that playing
together would have its drawbacks, as one is
inclined to be more nervous and critical with
regard to one&#8217;s own family. Actually the
brothers were more surprised by each other
than they could have surprised their audience.
</p>
<p>The change in costume, the gray in his hair,
the lines of makeup on his handsome boyish
face, gave Donald a look of maturity, while
Lance&#8217;s slenderness and the fact that he was
several inches smaller carried with it the
necessary suggestion of graceful youth.
</p>
<p>Together the father and son set forth to
their home, crowded with the suitors who,
believing Odysseus dead, have come to seek
the hand of Penelope.
</p>
<p>Instead of going directly to the palace they
retire toward the woods to suggest a lapse of
time.
</p>
<p>So far the Greek tableaux had been dominated
by single figures, chiefly the hero of
the poem.
</p>
<p>Now a change occurs.
</p>
<p>In the courtyard before the palace Penelope
is seen to appear accompanied by her
maidens.
</p>
<p>A serene and stately Penelope robed in ivory
and gold, her ash-brown hair braided and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
coiled low on her neck, a gold band in her
hair, Joan Peters had never looked so handsome.
</p>
<p>About her the troop of maidens like a swarm
of brilliant, many-colored flowers.
</p>
<p>They moved from the yard and onto a
broad space of ground untouched by tree or
shrub. Here the grass had been closely cut
so that it formed a velvet greensward.
</p>
<p>Penelope stands in the background and her
maidens advance.
</p>
<p>They were sixteen in number and represented
the four seasons.
</p>
<p>As Kara&#8217;s illness made it impossible for her
to be of their number, the sixteen girls were
not alone Girl Scouts from the camp in Beechwood
Forest. Four of them were gowned
in white, four in pale green, four in blue and
four in scarlet.
</p>
<p>Their costumes were like the simple, flowing
draperies of the Greek dancing girls seen upon
the friezes of the ancient Parthenon at Athens.
</p>
<p>Carefully Mrs. Phillips had made a study
of every detail of Greek dancing and costuming.
Anxious to impress the people of
Westhaven with her ability as a teacher of
dancing, she appreciated that no such opportunity
as the present one would be offered her
again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>Evan Phillips was to lead the Greek Dance
of the Four Seasons; one of the dancers
representing winter, she was dressed in white
and silver.
</p>
<p>Advancing, the entire line made a streak
of rainbow beauty upon the farther edge of
the silver stream of water.
</p>
<p>The line recedes, forming a crescent about
the solitary dancer.
</p>
<p>Then Evan danced alone. Her dancing was
a series of graceful gestures, of movements of
her arms and postures of her body, not toe
dancing or a skilful employment of her feet,
such as we associate with modern dancing.
</p>
<p>In the midst of her dancing she summons the
four seasons to advance. Winter comes first.
They seem to be blown forward by a gust of
winter wind that sets them dancing and
shivering forward. Supposedly the snow falls
and their arms, partly covered by delicate
white draperies, are raised as a shield.
</p>
<p>The sun shines, the snow melts and they
move backward to give place to the birth of
spring, the four Girl Scouts in shimmering
green costumes.
</p>
<p>The dance of the Spring recalled Evan
Phillips&#8217; dance of the young beech trees, save
that it was more stately. As far as possible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
her mother had adapted her idea to the Greek
model.
</p>
<p>Summer follows spring and the dance suggests
the blossoming of the flowers. The
scarlet succeeds the blue and autumn comes
with its portents of flying leaves and birds
moving southward.
</p>
<p>The dance ends and for the first time the
audience broke into enthusiastic applause.
Nothing so beautiful had ever been witnessed
in Westhaven!
</p>
<p>Penelope and her maidens return to the
palace. Later Odysseus wanders into his own
home, unrecognized by his family and friends.
</p>
<p>The Girl Scouts composed the household
of Penelope, the Boy Scouts found their
opportunity as the impatient suitors of the
lady Penelope. They remain about her palace,
playing at games, feasting and wasting her
substance and that of her son, Telemachus.
The hour must be near when she shall make
up her mind who is to fill the place of her lost
husband, Odysseus.
</p>
<p>In the games that took place the Boy Scouts
found their chance to exhibit their prowess in
outdoor sports.
</p>
<p>Penelope fetches the bow and the quiver full
of deadly arrows. She then goes to meet the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
princes, her attendants following carrying the
axes.
</p>
<p>To the suitor who wins at the trial of the
bow Penelope vows to give herself in marriage.
</p>
<p>Odysseus, with as little trouble as a minstrel
fits a new cord to his lyre, bends the mighty
bow with an arrow caught up from the table
at his side.
</p>
<p>Even when the bronze-tipped shaft goes
clean through twelve axes set up in a row, the
blinded Penelope fails to know her lord.
</p>
<p>The last scene reveals Odysseus, his shabby
coat cast aside, his figure no longer bent and
aged, a shining hero seated opposite Penelope
in the courtyard of his home, united at last
after long parting.
</p>
<p>The Greek tableaux were over. Within a
quarter of an hour the audience departed for
their homes, the Girl Scouts to their own
camp and the boys to theirs on the other side
of the hill. Yet not until bed-time was any
other subject discussed by the players and
their audience than the surprising success of
the Greek pageant given that afternoon in the
familiar setting of the New England woods.
</p>
<p>So the beauty of the past held its re-birth
in the present.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE PASSING</h3>
</div>

<p>Outside the opening into her tent
Teresa Peterson sat presumably playing
upon the banjo. The sounds she
was making were not particularly pleasing.
Yet the camp was fairly deserted. Only a
few of the other girls were to be seen and they
were busy and nowhere near Teresa.
</p>
<p>In fact, the camp in Beechwood Forest
would be vacant within the next few days.
Summer was closing with the soft loveliness
that makes one forgive and forget her less
charming moods.
</p>
<p>Already the evergreen house, which had
been the center of the camp life, was being
dismantled.
</p>
<p>Katherine Moore had returned to the Gray
House on the Hill. After the performance of
the Greek tableaux she had not been so well
and Dr. McClain had additional reasons for
desiring her presence in town at this time.
</p>
<p>Impatient always to fulfill his own wishes,
no sooner was Mr. Hammond aware of Kara&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
departure to town than he requested permission
to have the floor of the old cabin removed
and the search begun. Kara was not to be
told of the effort until the work was accomplished.
Not one chance in a thousand, Mr.
Hammond agreed, that any trace of Kara&#8217;s
past history be located here, therefore she
had best not be excited or worried until the
task was finished.
</p>
<p>This afternoon, as Teresa twanged at her
banjo strings, she looked oftener than was
good for her music at the group of men who
were at work in the evergreen cabin.
</p>
<p>So far they had only started the removal
of the old boards.
</p>
<p>When this was concluded the Girl Scouts
had determined to organize the searching
parties among themselves. Mr. Hammond
would join them; no one else was supposed to
feel a sufficiently keen interest in the investigation
to be allowed to take part.
</p>
<p>In spite of her music Teresa observed Lance
McClain coming toward the Girl Scout camp
when he was still some distance away. He
was not wearing his Scout uniform as might
have been expected.
</p>
<p>Even at a distance Lance appeared unlike
the other boys. He was smaller than a number
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
of them, more slender and graceful. He
had a peculiar carriage of the head. He
seemed to bend forward slightly and yet his
eyes were nearly always upturned. He apparently
did not look at the objects directly in
front of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Lance, I am awfully glad to see
you! I was feeling dull,&#8221; Teresa called out.
&#8220;How did you happen to walk over to camp
and not be wearing your uniform? Miss
Mason is lying down in her tent; if you like
I&#8217;ll tell her you are here and then you can
stay and talk to me, or else I&#8217;ll play to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance made a funny grimace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks awfully, Teresa, but I want to see
Dorothy for a special reason. I can&#8217;t stay
long. I wonder if you will tell me where I
can find her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Teresa frowned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you always claimed to be fond
of music, Lance, so I don&#8217;t see why you need
be in such a hurry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Teresa twanged at her banjo, a little
angrily on this occasion, so that the boy&#8217;s
sensitive face twitched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, for goodness sake don&#8217;t make that
noise, please, Teresa, and don&#8217;t be annoyed.
I&#8217;d like to talk to you if I had time. I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
think I am fond of the banjo as a musical
instrument, but I&#8217;ve simply got to find
Dorothy. If you don&#8217;t know where she is will
you ask Miss Mason? Tell her it is important
or I would not have appeared. Oh, yes, I
know the Boy Scouts are more welcome visitors
at present than they were, still I really
have too much else to do ordinarily!&#8221;
</p>
<p>So worried was Lance&#8217;s expression that
Teresa relented.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might tell me what you have on your
mind. If you don&#8217;t wish to, why, I do know
where Dorothy is. She and Tory Drew and
Louise and little Lucy rowed over to the
other side of the lake, not far off. If you are
in a hurry you can take the other canoe and
join them. It will require less time than walking
around the shore and I&#8217;ll go with you if
you&#8217;d like to have me come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance flushed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will think I am rude I am afraid,
Teresa, but it is rather a private matter I
want to talk over with Dorothy, so if you
don&#8217;t object I&#8217;ll row over alone. Some other
time you and I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it does not make any difference,&#8221; she
returned, and began humming a gay little
tune and playing more softly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>As he entered the silver canoe and started
paddling across the shallow lake Lance regretted
his decision. His was a nature not so
uncommon as people suppose. He disliked
hurting people in small ways, in larger and
more important ways he was apparently
indifferent.
</p>
<p>He liked Teresa and thought her extremely
pretty.
</p>
<p>After all, Dorothy would not be alone,
although they could go off somewhere nearby
together. Yet Lance knew he would not
particularly object to the presence of Louise
Miller and Tory Drew.
</p>
<p>No difficulty arose in discovering the group
of girls. Before Lance shoved his boat from
the shore he observed them at a point about
three-quarters of the way down the opposite
shore. He could not distinguish one from the
other nor tell the exact number.
</p>
<p>As he approached nearer he observed that
Tory was seated with an easel in front of her,
and at a short distance away Lucy was posing.
The other girls were not in sight.
</p>
<p>So intent was Tory upon her work that she
did not see Lance until he was within a few
yards. Then he called out to her, and Lucy,
glad of a chance to change her position, ran
down to meet him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>They came up hand in hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so bad, Tory, for a girl, and one no
older than you!&#8221; Lance murmured, staring
at the drawing of the youthful artist, his
brows drawn into a fine line, half of criticism,
half envy.
</p>
<p>Donald and Dorothy McClain and most of
her younger companions would have felt only
enthusiastic admiration for Tory&#8217;s work. Had
they known, Lance&#8217;s attitude was more flattering.
He expected more of Tory&#8217;s ability
than the others knew how to expect.
</p>
<p>She shook her head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my third attempt, Lance, to make
a picture of Lucy that I shall be willing to
submit to the judges in our Council or show
father. I can&#8217;t try again, we are going away
from camp so soon. Now and then I think
this may do, and at others I am discouraged.
I must not talk about myself. How did you
happen to turn up here? Are you looking
for Dorothy? I hope there is nothing the
matter, you are so serious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before it became necessary for Lance to
reply a voice interrupted him.
</p>
<p>Overhearing the conversation, Dorothy and
Louise Miller, who had not been far away,
were returning.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>With an unexpected display of affection,
Dorothy McClain, not accustomed to showing
her emotions, put her arm through her
brother&#8217;s and held tight to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing not in your Scout
uniform, Lance? We were just saying that
it was too dreadful to think that our summer
camping days in Beechwood Forest would soon
be a thing of the past. Nevertheless, I will
be kind of glad to return to my own family.
Tory and Ouida and I have been making all
sorts of plans for the winter. You must
help us with some of them, Lance, you and
Don.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid I won&#8217;t be able to, Dorothy,&#8221;
Lance answered in an odd voice.
</p>
<p>The three girls studied him more intently.
</p>
<p>Lucy, seldom interested in the conversation
of older persons, had wandered away and was
throwing pebbles into the clear water.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not, Lance? You are not usually
unaccommodating, and though you may consider
you are wasting your valuable time to
spend any of it with girls, you won&#8217;t count
Tory and Ouida and me with the others?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be at home next winter, Dorothy,
at least I think not. I came out to camp this
afternoon to have a private conversation with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
you, but if Ouida and Tory won&#8217;t be bored I
don&#8217;t mind if they hear what I wish to say.
Perhaps if you don&#8217;t see things my way to
the extent I want you to, they may help me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dorothy looked frightened. &#8220;Oh, Lance!
What in the world are you going to propose?
Please don&#8217;t ask me to take your part if you
have been having an argument with father.
I may not think you are in the right. Suppose
we have afternoon tea before you tell us anything.
We brought the tea things over in the
canoe and Ouida and I have been collecting
the materials for a fire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Doggedly Lance shook his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it will take more than a half hour
before the water can possibly boil. I can&#8217;t
wait so long.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have had an argument with father,
Dorothy. I don&#8217;t see how you managed to
guess. I went in to see him yesterday and
stayed all night at home. We talked until
after midnight. I am going back home now
after I have confided in you, so I did not care
to wear my uniform.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As if she suddenly had grown tired, Dorothy
seated herself on the ground, Lance standing
above and staring down at her an eager,
appealing light in his brown eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>Embarrassed by their own position, Tory
and Louise were moving away when a swift
inclination of Lance&#8217;s hand beckoned them to
remain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to stay, please do. I believe
Dot is going to be difficult. I did not think
so when I came out to talk things over with
her. She is always claiming that I am her
favorite brother yet when it comes to a test
she is far oftener on any one&#8217;s side than mine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not because I do not care for you
but because I feel you are often wrong,
Lance, and for your own sake I am obliged to
differ with you,&#8221; Dorothy answered, as if she
were on the defensive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, all right, here goes. Perhaps I
am wrong again,&#8221; Lance returned. &#8220;Nevertheless
you and father might as well understand
that I am in earnest and sooner or later
mean to have my way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this instant Lance sat down beside his
sister, Tory and Ouida following his example,
but a few feet away as if they were interested
but reluctant.
</p>
<p>Persuasively Lance placed his arm around
his sister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dot, does it ever occur to you that a fellow
may have a right to his mistakes? The rest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
of my family is so almighty sensible that if I
am never to be allowed to have my own way
I&#8217;ll never learn anything.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember about two weeks ago
when Mr. Fenton talked to us about the
Greek spirit? He said that to him it represented,
beauty, adventure and freedom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dorothy sighed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, Lance, I was afraid at the time
you might take Mr. Fenton&#8217;s speech personally!
What are you planning to do in
quest of beauty, freedom and adventure?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dorothy&#8217;s expression was worried but
amused, and Lance flushed. Upon only one
subject was he particularly sensitive, his
devotion to music and his own lack of any
knowledge of it.
</p>
<p>In a measure his sister could surmise something
of what he had in mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My effort was not to be a very serious one,
Dot,&#8221; he said slowly; &#8220;at least I did not feel
it go until after my talk with father. He seems
to have gone up in the air. I don&#8217;t want to
spend next winter in Westhaven. I simply
can not endure any longer never having music
lessons from any one who knows how to teach
and not even hearing any music worth
listening to.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>Lance set his teeth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t ask anyone to understand, you
can&#8217;t if you try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dorothy&#8217;s blue eyes grew more troubled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, Lance, but I do try,&#8221; she returned.
&#8220;And I would give anything, make any sacrifice
I knew how to make if father were willing
or had the money to send you to New York
to study. But he is not willing and he has
not the money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, that is just it. I don&#8217;t mean to
ask him for money. I have been writing
letters to people in New York and trying to
get work and now I have succeeded in landing
something that will give me enough to live
on, so you won&#8217;t have to worry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Lance, there is school. You are only
fifteen and you can&#8217;t stop school, it is even
against the law. You must have pretended
you were older.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can go to school at night when I have
finished working; I explained this to father,&#8221;
Lance argued patiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the music? When will you
have money or time for lessons?&#8221; Tory interrupted,
not intending to intrude upon the discussion,
but in her interest forgetting her
resolution.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>A little less self-confident Lance appeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, I don&#8217;t know, Tory,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I think I feel that if once I get where music
is, the opportunity will come to me as rain
and sunshine come to trees and the things that
need them. Gee whiz, I am talking like a
poet or a girl! Father would not think this
line of conversation convincing. You&#8217;ll think
up a better line of argument, won&#8217;t you
Dorothy? Then when your time comes and
you want something a whole lot I&#8217;ll do my
best for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Lance, I&mdash;&#8221; Dorothy hesitated&mdash;&#8220;I
don&#8217;t want you to go away from home; I don&#8217;t
think it best for you. You ought to wait
several years anyhow. You are not strong and
you&#8217;d be ill. You don&#8217;t believe it, but father
cares more for you than for the rest of us
because you are more like mother. Please
put things off a while longer in your own mind.
Truly, father will not consent for the present.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance got up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Dorothy, don&#8217;t say anything to
father on the subject. If you try to do your
best for me what you really think will be
plain enough. I am sorry to have interrupted
you; I&#8217;m off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nor would Lance remain in spite of the
pleading of his sister and friends.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>Disconsolately they watched the slender
figure in the canoe push away from shore.
</p>
<p>Afterwards they made no pretence of
cheerfulness. Tory would not return to her
drawing; Dorothy was too depressed even
to assist in making tea.
</p>
<p>An hour later they were on the way back
to their own camp.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>LETTERS</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. Jeremy Hammond personally
conducted the search.
</p>
<p>The evergreen cabin had been
erected without foundation save a number of
cross beams. There was no cellar except one
a few feet square under the small room that
served as a kitchen. The logs that upheld
the old house were singularly free from decay.
</p>
<p>Standing upon one of them, a line of Girl
Scouts on either side of him, Mr. Hammond
gazed downward with an air of discouragement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am obliged to confess I see no place that
gives one a right to believe we shall discover
a secret treasure,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I am glad
Kara is unaware of our effort. I was wrong
in speaking to her on the subject. I suppose
I am hopelessly romantic and have been
cherishing the idea of some day discovering
further information about the little girl I
rescued a number of years ago. We shall
find nothing here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory touched him on the arm.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Mr. Hammond, don&#8217;t let us start
out upon our search in such a hopeless spirit.
I feel as you say you do about Kara. Ever
since I met her I have been convinced we
would learn that she had a delightful background
of some kind, which would explain
why she is so brave and charming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Tory, I cannot go so far as you. I
have never anticipated so much. Besides, I
do not consider it necessary. Personality is
the strongest force in the world, not the
question of one&#8217;s immediate ancestors. I am
not decrying the ancestors, only if one possesses
an unusual personality it may come from further
back in the stream of life and the stream
was the same for us all in the beginning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have merely hoped to come across a
clue which might give Kara an idea of her
parentage, or perhaps, a relative who would
be kind and interested in her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory looked disappointed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kara has plenty of people who are interested
in her, and friends may be as satisfactory
as relatives.&#8221; In this sentiment Mr.
Hammond may or may not have agreed.
Already he had commenced tapping on the
logs with the end of his cane and digging
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
underneath in any stray spot that he hoped
might develop into the receptacle of a box or
treasure of some kind.
</p>
<p>The girls went about upon their own quests.
Unfortunate that there was no greater amount
of space, no secret chambers and passages to
be investigated. This would have lent a
glamour, a romance that nothing about the
little evergreen cabin afforded.
</p>
<p>An hour and the exploration became of
necessity over.
</p>
<p>Nothing of any interest had been unearthed.
</p>
<p>Disconsolately Mr. Hammond seated himself
upon an upturned stool. A few of the
Girl Scouts clustered about him; the others
unwilling to give up, were still poking about
in unlikely places.
</p>
<p>Alone Tory Drew&#8217;s original ardor continued
unquenched.
</p>
<p>All day she had a vision of herself going to
Kara at the old Gray House with information
that would bring a new happiness into the
clear gray eyes grown so wistful in these
weeks of a summer time they had thought to
be so happy.
</p>
<p>No one place had been more thoroughly
searched than the corners of the old brick
fireplace that divided the living room and the
kitchen with a single chimney.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>Yet kneeling down once more Tory began
a last search, poking about into impossible
crannies.
</p>
<p>Exhausted, she finally surrendered. No
reward was to be theirs, and they had only
been wasting valuable energy and time.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless Tory did not feel in the mood
for discussing this obvious fact with the others.
</p>
<p>Near the old fireplace was a small collection
of loose bricks. Arranging them into a low
square Tory seated herself, leaning her head
against the left corner of the chimney.
</p>
<p>Suddenly she had a sensation of dizziness.
Her head seemed to be swimming from the
fatigue perhaps and the disappointment of
her futile search.
</p>
<p>She straightened, biting her lips and wondering
why she was not more physically uncomfortable
than she felt herself to be.
</p>
<p>Then hearing a crumbling noise behind her,
Tory turned her eyes. The bricks against
which her head had been resting had been
loosened. She had not been dizzy, the movement
had taken place <i>in them</i>.
</p>
<p>Picking up a stick that lay beside her feet
she thrust it idly inside a tiny crevice.
</p>
<p>Actually by this time Tory had lost interest
in what had been an ardent enthusiasm earlier
in the day.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>She was excited, however, when a brick,
displaced from its former position, tumbled to
the ground, yet for the moment uttered no
exclamation that might attract attention.
</p>
<p>Thrusting her hand into the opening she
tugged at another brick. The exertion was
unnecessary. It yielded at once to her touch.
Two other bricks were as easily removed.
</p>
<p>Tory then discovered a hollow opening
several feet deep.
</p>
<p>There was nothing visible inside; the space
appeared dark and empty.
</p>
<p>Then Tory did call out and Mr. Hammond
and the group of Girl Scouts crowded close
about her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind thrusting your hand
inside and seeing if there is anything stored
away? I don&#8217;t think it very nice of me to
ask you because I am afraid of touching
something spooky or clammy. Do you mind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Apparently Mr. Hammond did not object.
Unmindful of his coat sleeve, he was thrusting
the entire length of his arm into the hollow
recess.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if this was not a Dutch oven
that was covered over when it failed to be
used. In that case I may find a petrified loaf
of bread or pumpkin pie,&#8221; Mr. Hammond
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
remarked in a slightly ironical tone, bored by
this time.
</p>
<p>An instant later his expression altered
sufficiently for the group of girls watching to
become conscious of the change. The next he
drew forth a small package of letters tied
together with a worn cord.
</p>
<p>Were they of the remotest interest or value?
</p>
<p>No one could say. At least the audience
was willing to offer them the benefit of an
investigation.
</p>
<p>Joan Peters went away to her tent, returning
with a candle.
</p>
<p>If there was anything else inside the dark
enclosure the lighted candle would show it
forth.
</p>
<p>Except for the letters the recess was empty.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hammond continued to hold the packet
and stare at it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you had best open the
letters and read what they say?&#8221; Tory asked
restlessly, wishing that Mr. Hammond would
give her the opportunity. After all, she had
been the real discoverer, even if her hands
had not first touched the yellowed papers.
Perhaps they would contain thrilling information
for Kara. She might be an heiress or
possessed of a more romantic heritage.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>Mr. Hammond appeared doubtful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; I don&#8217;t feel as if I were at
liberty to open the letters. I have no authority
and they can have no association with me.
Perhaps I had best speak first to Dr. McClain
and then take them to Kara.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Hammond,&#8221; Dorothy McClain
protested, &#8220;why should you conclude that a
small package of letters discovered in the way
that we have come across these can have any
connection with Katherine Moore? The letters
may have been thrust into the old fireplace
to burn and been forgotten. Surely
there can be no objection to your looking
over them first! Then you may be able to
decide to whom they should be presented.
After all, the little evergreen cabin belongs to
our Troop of Girl Scouts. Mr. Fenton bought
the place and gave it to us. You have our
permission. Besides, we would like to look
at the letters with you. I am so excited I
really cannot endure to wait any longer.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>LOOKING FORWARD</h3>
</div>

<p>Devoted attention to every line contained
in the little package of letters
failed to develop information which
appeared to be of interest to Katherine Moore
or any one else.
</p>
<p>Carefully each line was read by Mr. Hammond
and the Girl Scouts on the afternoon
of their discovery. Later the letters were
given to Dr. McClain and to Mr. Hale, Margaret
Hale&#8217;s father, who was a prominent
lawyer, for an equally painstaking perusal.
They agreed that they were merely a trivial
collection such as any one might receive from
a dozen friends, preserved for the sake of the
affection, not the value of the communications.
</p>
<p>There were no papers save the letters.
</p>
<p>Only one or two seemingly unimportant
details connected the letters in any possible
fashion with Katherine Moore. Three of
them were signed with the initials O. M.,
which may or may not have had any association
with the name Moore. In point of fact,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
it would have appeared a straining of the
imagination, save that the name Moore was
signed to one short note.
</p>
<p>In any case, it was agreed that, since there
was no one else to claim them, the little package
might be consigned to the girl who was
discovered as a baby in the forsaken cabin.
No one had been known to be living there at
the time, so there was no reason to believe
otherwise than that the baby had been carried
there and immediately abandoned.
</p>
<p>As Dr. McClain was at present seeing Kara
daily at the Gray House, the letters were given
to him for safe delivery. Not until twenty-four
hours after was Tory Drew permitted to
call and find what the influence and effect of
so unsatisfying a communication had been.
</p>
<p>She found Kara in the big room downstairs
which had been given over to her use since
her accident whenever she was living at the
Gray House.
</p>
<p>When Tory entered the room Kara must
have been re-reading the letters, since they
lay open upon her lap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were not disappointed over our discovery,
dear? The letters do mean something
to you? You have the faith to believe that
something important to <i>you</i> will develop from
them some day? I believe it if you do.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>Kara laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Beloved Tory, if with all your imagination
and sense of romance you could find nothing
of value in the old letters why expect it of a
practical, matter-of-fact, stupid person like I
am? The letters are ridiculous to my mind so
far as they are supposed to have any reference
to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Still the gray eyes were shining and to-day
Tory beheld the half quizzical lines about the
lips that belonged to the Kara of other days.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you have no faith in the letters,
why do you seem so much happier and like
your old self?&#8221; she queried.
</p>
<p>Her companion hesitated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t Dr. McClain told you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has told me nothing save that I might
come to see you if I would not stay too long,
which is the permission he gives to all our
Girl Scouts.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Kara&#8217;s voice was steady with the old-time
gentle drawl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Promise me then not to expect too much
or be too disappointed if things do not turn
out altogether well? Of course I am happier
to-day, happier than a dozen letters proclaiming
me an heiress could ever make me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. McClain and two other surgeons who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
have seen me believe there is a possibility I
may be well. They are not absolutely sure.
Don&#8217;t look so queer, Tory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t look queer, go on,&#8221; the other girl
whispered, bending her face down so that her
lips touched Kara&#8217;s hair and her face could
not be seen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t anything else to tell, except
that I am to go to New York City to be
treated and to spend the winter and that Mr.
Fenton and Mr. Hammond and Dr. McClain
and several other people have made the
arrangements and will pay all my expenses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Here for the first time Kara&#8217;s voice trembled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says one cannot have beautiful
things happen to one even if lost letters do
prove disappointing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She put out her hand and caught hold of
her companion&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tory, you don&#8217;t think I have failed to
appreciate your loveliness to me this summer.
All the time when I have appeared most
ungrateful I have cared most. I won&#8217;t talk
about it now, only as you are an artist you
understand better than I how one may see
things in a wrong perspective. My view is
clearer now whatever happens.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory kneeled down:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I might be Ruth to your Naomi.&#8221;

<h3>KARA&#8217;S DEPARTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>Believing that it would do his patient
no possible injury, Dr. McClain agreed
that Kara should see as many of her
friends as she desired upon the last few days
before departing for New York City.
</p>
<p>Every spare hour Kara and Tory were together.
The last few days Miss Victoria
Fenton had asked Kara to stay with them at
their home in the village. Farewell could
be more easily said from there than at the
Gray House on the edge of the town. There
would be less difficulty in finally getting away.
</p>
<p>Dr. McClain was to accompany Kara to
New York in order to see the New York
physicians. Mr. Jeremy Hammond had
offered to motor them down, as he owned a
handsome car and Kara would be spared
having to be lifted in and out of the train.
</p>
<p>Kara&#8217;s farewell Scout meeting was by her
own request a quiet one. No one would be
present save the Scout Captain and her own
Patrol. There was only one other person
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
who would come for half an hour to say good-by,
Memory Frean.
</p>
<p>Fortunately the Fenton house had a bedroom
on the first floor, so that Kara could be
comfortable without the problem of the stairs.
</p>
<p>One admirer Kara had acquired without
realizing the fact. She was to make the discovery
on the afternoon that she and Miss
Victoria Fenton sat talking, waiting for Tory
to announce that preparations were ready for
tea.
</p>
<p>From the beginning of Tory&#8217;s first acquaintance
with Katharine Moore, Miss Fenton had
been quietly watching the other girl. She
had liked Kara&#8217;s fashion of never referring
to the difference between her own life and
that of her more fortunate friends. When it
was natural to mention the orphan asylum,
where she made her home, always she spoke
of the place with affection, never criticism or
resentment.
</p>
<p>Knowing nothing of her parentage, Miss
Victoria concluded for reasons of her own that
Kara had come of well-bred people. And she
meant more than ordinary breeding. She
was under the impression that Kara revealed
rare tact and sweetness in a difficult situation.
Now and then she considered that her attitude
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
bore a quality of high courage. But not until
after Kara&#8217;s accident was Miss Fenton convinced
that courage was the characteristic
that lay behind her other attributes.
</p>
<p>In the twenty-four hours the young girl
had been her guest with the prospect of such
a test of patience and fortitude before her,
Miss Victoria had surrendered completely.
</p>
<p>Silently Tory Drew had been aware of Miss
Victoria&#8217;s state of mind. She had observed a
new tenderness in the older woman&#8217;s manner
and voice whenever she spoke or looked at
her guest that she never had seen her display.
</p>
<p>This afternoon on the day before Kara&#8217;s
departure, when Miss Victoria entered Kara&#8217;s
bedroom, with a hurried excuse Tory withdrew.
</p>
<p>Kara, who was lying on a couch in a dark
corner of the square old room, struggled to sit
up as the older woman entered.
</p>
<p>With hands that were large and kind the
older woman pushed her gently back upon
the pile of soft cushions.
</p>
<p>Then, untying a parcel and flushing as
if she were embarrassed, Miss Victoria laid
a dressing gown over the reclining figure.
</p>
<p>The gown was a beautiful one, with nothing
of the plainness or severity one might have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
imagined Miss Victoria would choose. It
was of blue silk, the shade known as old blue,
indescribably deep and soft in tone. The
lining was of pale gray. A little hood hung
at the back and a cord was knotted about the
waist.
</p>
<p>Kara might wear it for a number of occasions.
She could receive guests in it, as it
would doubtless be difficult for her at all times
to be formally dressed.
</p>
<p>Kara&#8217;s voice shook a little as she touched
the silk with one hand and caught Miss Victoria&#8217;s
hand with the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody is being too good to me. I
wonder if it is going to make it harder or easier
for me this winter. I shall miss my friends
the more and at the same time want to show
them how deeply I appreciate what is being
done. May I write to you now and then,
Miss Victoria?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Fenton showed and expressed pleasure,
although she had written her niece only a
single letter in more than a month&#8217;s absence
from the village.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have something else for you, Kara,
something I want you to prize, not because
of its great value but because it means a great
deal to me.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It was given me by the bravest person I
have known. I will not tell you about him
now. Perhaps I will some day. If ever life
seems to be too difficult for you, my dear,
you must tell me and then perhaps my story
may help you find new courage. Please don&#8217;t
speak of this to any one except to say I wished
to give you the little pin as a parting gift.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Tory softly turned the handle of the door
to come back into the room and announce
the Girl Scouts, she observed Miss Fenton
stoop and pin at Kara&#8217;s throat a small pin.
As she came nearer she saw that it was a
beautiful sapphire set in an old-fashioned
band of gold. In truth, the pin was handsomer
than either girl appreciated.
</p>
<p>A moment later, before Kara could thank
her properly, the older woman hurried away,
insisting she had a household duty to look
after.
</p>
<p>The Girl Scouts had been warned.
</p>
<p>Kara&#8217;s farewell to her Patrol must be as
casual and matter-of-fact as possible. There
must be no heroics at parting; she would leave
in the early morning and must reserve all her
strength.
</p>
<p>At shortly after five o&#8217;clock the girls and
the Troop Captain had departed and Kara was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
again lying down alone until the evening
meal.
</p>
<p>Afterwards Dr. McClain and Dorothy were
to come in for a few moments.
</p>
<p>Kara and Tory, Miss Victoria and Mr.
Richard Fenton were in the drawing-room
when they entered. Unexpectedly Lance
accompanied them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We did not intend allowing Lance to
appear, Kara,&#8221; Dorothy apologized, &#8220;but
he insisted he had something of special importance
to say to you and never had been
allowed the opportunity, you have been so
surrounded.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Not long after, stating that he was satisfied
with her condition, Dr. McClain departed
to call upon another patient. A few minutes
later Miss Victoria and Mr. Fenton left the
drawing-room to the younger guests.
</p>
<p>Kara was in her wheeled chair. Lance was
standing near her. Dorothy was seated on a
stool nearby, while Tory remained on the rug
with her back to the fire, facing the others.
</p>
<p>Dorothy smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember, Kara? Tory is wearing
a green dress to-night as upon the occasion
of our first visit to this drawing-room to ask
her to become a Girl Scout. Dear me, what
is that commotion?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>The two girls ran over toward the window.
Lance had the thoughtfulness to wheel Kara&#8217;s
chair so that she might equally gratify her
curiosity.
</p>
<p>Tory had drawn up the curtain and the
four of them could see a small group of figures
standing in the street beneath the drawing-room
window.
</p>
<p>There was a light coating of snow on the
sidewalk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world is the matter?&#8221; Dorothy
asked anxiously. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t Don one of the
boys down there? I wonder what they intend?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance made an odd grimace.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Intend? Good gracious! I always felt
Don had no sense of humor, but this is worse
than I feared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you girls appreciate the fact this
is to be a farewell serenade for Kara? Yet
Don has read &#8216;Seventeen&#8217;! They are half
a dozen of the Boy Scout Band.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very kind of them, I am sure; no
reason for you to be so superior, Lance,&#8221; Tory
answered.
</p>
<p>Outside the musicians were beginning the
strains of &#8220;Auld Lang Syne&#8221; and the little
crowd inside the room were silent, Tory
thrusting the girl for whom the honor was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
intended into the most conspicuous position
and a moment later wrapping a blue scarf
about her thin shoulders.
</p>
<p>With their heads close together they listened
and watched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we to do when they have finished,
Tory, to show our appreciation?&#8221; Kara
whispered. &#8220;I am afraid Dr. McClain would
not be willing to have me see them. Shall I
go to my room while you receive them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Tory shook her head, glancing about
the room. On a center table was a bowl of
red roses, the flowers Mr. Fenton cared for
most, that he had brought as a farewell offering
to Kara.
</p>
<p>Tory gathered half a dozen in her hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw these out and wave good-night,&#8221;
she murmured.
</p>
<p>Kara was not able to reach so far and seemed
shy at making the attempt, so that the other
girl threw the roses and saw them fall, crimson
spots of color on the white snow.
</p>
<p>Don picked one up and waved it, lifting his
hat. The other boys followed his example.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, good-by, Kara,&#8221; they called.
</p>
<p>Donald&#8217;s last glance and good-by was for
Tory Drew.
</p>
<p>As they closed the window and reluctantly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
turned away, Dorothy McClain wore an unusual
expression. She was frowning and
biting her lips, her color warmer than usual.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, Tory, I believe Don is
growing to be as fond of you as of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She slipped her arm through Lance&#8217;s and
held it close.
</p>
<p>Lance gave her a reassuring glance.
</p>
<p>Tory laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never in a thousand years! But if Lance
really wants to speak to Kara, perhaps he
would rather we give him the opportunity
alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you come over here and sit on
the sofa beside me. You must be specially
good to me when Kara is away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Seldom was Lance awkward in manner or
apparently at a loss for words. Now he appeared
embarrassed and silent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, please don&#8217;t go away, Tory, you and
Dot, not if you can bear remaining. And
you must, to brace up Kara. The truth is I
had nothing special to say to her, but the
other afternoon I composed a little piece of
music in her honor as a farewell. I am wiser
to-night and she shall not be afflicted with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Lance&#8217;s brown eyes were slightly
sarcastic, slightly challenging.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How can you care for my poor efforts
after the serenade?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory made no answer save to attempt to
lift the cover from the piano, so that Lance
was compelled to come to her assistance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Lance,&#8221; she ordered quietly,
attempting to place the stool in position.
&#8220;I am glad to say the old piano was tuned
only a few days ago, although no one here
uses it. You know you want to play what
you have written for Kara, so why pretend
otherwise?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tory&#8217;s manner left no chance for argument,
so Lance, with a whimsical smile of agreement,
meekly obeyed.
</p>
<p>He sat under a light from a reading lamp,
the two girls standing beside Kara&#8217;s chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My musical composition has the advantage
of not being long and is merely an attempt
to express our sorrow over Kara&#8217;s departure,
our faith in her good courage and
our splendid hope for her return. Yes, and
perhaps a little of my envy that she goes to
the city of my dreams. Perhaps after all I
shall meet her there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lance&#8217;s words trailed away into silence as
his slender fingers touched the keys in a simple
melody of farewell.
